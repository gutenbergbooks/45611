there when he had placed himselfe in the court of the Kings bench, declared to
the audience, that he would take vpon him the crowne in that place there, where the
king himselfe sitteth and ministreth the law, bicause he considered that it was the
chiefest dutie of a king to minister the lawes. Then with as pleasant an oration as he
could, he went about to win vnto him the nobles, the merchants, the artificers, and in
conclusion all kind of men, but especiallie the lawiers of this realme. And finallie
to the intent that no man should hate him for feare, and that his deceitfull clemencie
might get him the good will of the people, when he had declared the discommodities
of discord, &amp; the co&#772;modities of concord &amp; vnitie, he made an open proclamation, that
he did put out of his mind all enimities, and that he there did openlie pardon all
offenses committed against him.</p>

<p>And to the intent that he might shew a proofe therof, he commanded that one Fog,
whom he had long deadlie hated, should be brought then before him, who being
brought out of the sanctuarie (for thither had he fled for feare of him) in the sight of the
people he tooke him by the hand. Which thing the common people reioised at, and
praised, but wise men tooke it for a vanitie. In his returne homeward, whome so
euer he met, he saluted. For a mind that knoweth it selfe guiltie, is in a manner
deiected to a seruile flatterie [which refuseth no dutifulnesse, tend the same to neuer

of his nephue. (*) But here to shew the manner of his coronation, as the
same is inserted in this pamphlet of sir Thomas More, by maister Edward Hall and
Richard Grafton (although not found in the same pamphlet) thus we find it by them

men of the north against his coronation, which came vp euill apparelled, and worse
harnessed, in rustie harnesse, neither defensible, nor scowred to the sale, which mustered
in Finsburie field to the great disdaine of the lookers on. [By which beginning

<div class="sidenote">The solemne ceremonies vsed at king Richards coronation.</div>

<p>On the morow, being the sixt daie of Iulie, the king with qu&eacute;ene Anne his wife,
came downe out of the White hall into the great hall at Westminster, and went directlie
into the kings Bench. And from thense, the king and the qu&eacute;ene going vpon
raie cloth barefooted, went vnto saint Edwards shrine, and all his nobilitie going with
him, euerie lord in his degr&eacute;e. And first went the trumpets, and then the heralds of
armes in their rich coats, &amp; next followed the crosse with a solemne procession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
the priests hauing fine surplisses and graie amisses vpon them. The abbats and
bishops mitred and in rich copes, &amp; euerie of them caried their crosiers in their hands.
The bishop of Rochester bare the crosse before the cardinall. Then followed the earle
of Huntington bearing a paire of gilt spurres, signifieng knighthood. Then followed
the earle of Bedford bearing saint Edwards staffe for a relike.</p>

<p>After them came the earle of Northumberland bareheaded, with the pointlesse
sword naked in his hand, which signified mercie. The lord Stanleie bare the mace of
the constableship. The earle of Kent bare the second sword on the right hand of the
king naked, with a point, which signified iustice vnto the temporaltie. The lord Louell
bare the third sword on the left hand with a point, which signified iustice to the
cleargie. The duke of Suffolke followed with the scepter in his hand, which signified
peace. The earle of Lincolne bare the ball and crosse, which signified monarchie.
The erle of Surrie bare the fourth sword before the king in a rich scabberd, and that
is called the sword of estate. Then went thr&eacute;e togither, in the middest went Garter
king at armes in his rich cote: and on his left hand went the maior of London, bearing
a mace: and on his right hand went the gentleman vsher of the priuie chamber.
Then followed the duke of Norffolke, bearing the kings crowne betw&eacute;ene his hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Qu&eacute;ene Anne wife to king Richard and daughter to
Richard earle of Warwike and his traine.</div>

<p>Then followed king Richard in his robes of purple veluet, and ouer his head a canopie,
borne by foure barons of the cinque ports. And on euerie side of the king
there went one bishop, that is to saie, the bishop of Bath, and the bishop of Durham.
Then followed the duke of Buckingham bearing the kings traine, with a white staffe
in his hand, signifieng the office of the high steward of England. Then there followed
a great number of earles and barons before the qu&eacute;ene. And then came the
earle of Huntington, who bare the qu&eacute;enes scepter, and the vicount Lisle bearing the
rod with the doue. And the earle of Wilshire bare the qu&eacute;enes crowne. Then followed
qu&eacute;ene Anne daughter to Richard earle of Warwike in robes like to the king,
betw&eacute;ene two bishops, and a canopie ouer hir head borne by the barons of the ports.
On hir head a rich coronet set with stones and pearle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king &amp; qu&eacute;ene crowned.</div>

<p>After hir followed the countesse of Richmond heire to the duke of Summerset,
which bare vp the qu&eacute;enes traine. After followed the duchesse of Suffolke and
Norffolke, with countesses, baronesses, ladies, and manie faire gentlewomen. In this
order they passed through the palace, and entered the abbeie at the west end; and so
came to their seats of estate. And after diuerse songs solemnelie soong, they both
ascended to the high altar, and were shifted from their robes, and had diuerse places
open from the middle vpward, in which places they were annointed. Then both the
king and the qu&eacute;ene changed them into cloth of gold, and ascended to their seats,
where the cardinall of Canturburie, &amp; other bishops them crowned according to the
custome of the realme, giuing him the scepter in the left hand, &amp; the ball with the
crosse in the right hand; and the qu&eacute;ene had the scepter in hir right hand, and the
rod with the doue in her left hand.</p>

<p>On euerie side of the king stood a duke, and before him stood the earle of Surrie
with the sword in his hands. And on euerie side of the qu&eacute;ene standing a bishop, &amp;
a ladie kn&eacute;eling. The cardinal soong masse, and after pax, the king and the qu&eacute;ene
descended, and before the high altar they were both houseled, with one host diuided
betw&eacute;ene them. After masse finished, they both offered at saint Edward his shrine,
and there the king left the crowne of saint Edward, and put on his owne crowne.
And so in order as they came, they departed to Westminster hall; and so to their
chambers for a season: during which time the duke of Norffolke came into the hall,
his horsse trapped to the ground in cloth of gold, as high marshall, and voided the
hall. About foure of the clocke, the king and qu&eacute;ene entered the hall, and the king
sate in the middle, and the qu&eacute;ene on the left hand of the table, and on euerie side of
hir stood a countesse, holding a cloth of pleasance, when she list to drinke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<p>And on the right hand of the king sat the bishop of Canturburie. The ladies sat
all on one side, in the middle of the hall. And at the table against them sat the chancellor
and all the lords. At the table next the cupboord, sat the maior of London;
and at the table behind the lords, sat the barons of the ports: and at the other tables
sat noble and worshipfull personages. When all persons were set, the duke of
Norffolke earle marshall, the earle of Surrie, constable for that daie, the lord Stanlie lord
steward, sir William Hopton treasurer, &amp; sir Thomas Persie controller, came in and
serued the king solemnelie, with one dish of gold, and an other of siluer, and the
qu&eacute;ene all in gilt vessell, and the bishop all in siluer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Robert Dimmocke the kings champion his
challenge in the behalfe of king Richard.</div>

<p>At the second course came into the hall sir Robert Dimmocke the kings champion,
making proclamation, that whosoeuer would saie, that king Richard was not lawfull
king, he would fight with him at the vtterance, and threw downe his gantlet, and then
all the hall cried; king Richard. And so he did in thr&eacute;e parts of the hall, and then
one brought him a cup of wine couered, and when he had drunke, he cast out the
drinke, and departed with the cup. After that, the heralds cried a largesse thrise in
the hall, and so went vp to their stage. At the end of dinner, the maior of London
serued the king &amp; qu&eacute;ene with sw&eacute;ete wine, and had of each of them a cup of gold,
with a couer of gold. And by that time that all was doone, it was darke night. And
so the king returned to his chamber, and euerie man to his lodging.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A gaie pretense of iustice and equitie.</div>

<p>When this feast was thus finished, the king sent home all the lords into their countries
that would depart, except the lord Stanleie, whom he reteined, till he heard what
his sonne the lord Strange went about. And to such as went home, he gaue streight
charge and commandement, to s&eacute;e their countries well ordered, and that no wrong
nor extortion should be doone to his subiects. And thus he taught other to execute
iustice and equitie, the contrarie whereof he dailie exercised. He also with great rewards
giuen to the Northernemen, which he sent for to his coronation, sent them
home to their countrie with great thanks: whereof diuerse of them (as they be all of
nature verie gr&eacute;edie of authoritie, &amp; speciallie when they thinke to haue anie comfort or
fauour) tooke on them so highlie, and wrought such maisteries, that the king was
faine to ride thither in his first yeare, and to put some in execution, and staie the
countrie, or else no small misch&eacute;efe had insued.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Sir Thomas More</i> againe.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Perkin Werbecke.</div>

<p>Now fell there misch&eacute;efs thicke. And as the thing euill gotten is neuer well kept,
thorough all the time of his reigne neuer ceassed there cruell death and slaughter, till
his owne destruction ended it. But as he finished his time with the best death and
the most righteous, that is to wit, his owne; so began he with the most pitious and
wicked, I meane the lamentable murther of his innocent nephues, the yoong king
and his tender brother: whose death and finall infortune hath naitheless comen so
farre in question, that some remaine yet in doubt, whether they were in his daies destroied
or no. Not for that onelie that Perkin Werbecke by manie folks malice, and
mo folks follie, so long space abusing the world, was as well with princes as the poorer
people reputed and taken for the yoonger of these two; but for that also that all
things were in late daies so couertlie demeaned, one thing pretended, and an other
meant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Close dealing is euer suspected.</div>

<p>Insomuch that there was nothing so plaine and openlie prooued, but that yet for
the common custome of close and couert dealing, men had it euer inwardlie suspect;
as manie well counterfaited iewels make the true mistrusted. Howbeit, concerning
the opinion, with the occasions moouing either partie, we shall haue place more at
large to intreat, if we hereafter happen to write the time of the late noble prince of
famous memorie king Henrie the seauenth, or percase that historie of Perkin in anie
compendious processe by it selfe. But in the meane time, for this present matter, I shall
rehearse you the dolorous end of those babes, not after euerie waie that I haue heard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
but after that waie, that I haue so heard by such men and by such meanes, as me
thinketh it were hard but it should be true.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iohn Gr&eacute;ene.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Robert Brakenberie constable of the Tower.</div>

<p>King Richard after his coronation, taking his waie to Glocester to visit (in his new
honour) the towne of which he bare the name of his old, deuised (as he rode) to
fulfill the thing which he before had intended. And forsomuch as his mind gaue him,
that his nephues liuing, men would not reckon that he could haue right to the realme:
he thought therefore without delaie to rid them, as though the killing of his kinsmen
could amend his cause, and make him a kindlie king. Whervpon he sent one
Iohn Gr&eacute;ene, (whom he speciallie trusted) vnto sir Robert Brakenberie, constable of
the Tower, with a letter and credence also, that the same sir Robert should in anie
wise put the two children to death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The murther of the two young princes set abroch.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Iames Tirrell described.</div>

<p>This Iohn Gr&eacute;ene did his errand vnto Brakenberie, kn&eacute;eling before our ladie in the
Tower. Who plainelie answered, that he would neuer put them to death to die
therefore. With which answer Iohn Gr&eacute;ene returning, recounted the same to king Richard
at Warwike yet in his waie. Wherewith he tooke such displeasure &amp; thought,
that the same night he said vnto a secret page of his: "Ah! whom shall a man trust?
Those that I haue brought vp my selfe, those that I had w&eacute;ent would most suerlie
serue me, euen those faile me, and at my commandement will doo nothing for
me." "Sir (quoth his page) there lieth one on your pallet without, that I dare well
saie, to doo your grace pleasure, the thing were right hard that he would refuse."
Meaning this by sir Iames Tirrell, which was a man of right goodlie personage, and
for natures gifts worthie to haue serued a much better prince, if he had well serued
God, and by grace obteined as much truth and good will as he had strength and
wit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Authoritie loueth no partners.</div>

<p>The man had an high heart, &amp; sore longed vpward, not rising yet so fast as he had
hoped, being hindered &amp; kept vnder by the meanes of sir Richard Ratcliffe, and
sir William Catesbie, which longing for no mo parteners of the princes fauour; and
namelie, not for him, whose pride they wist would beare no p&eacute;ere, kept him by secret
drifts out of all secret trust, which thing this page well had marked and knowne.
Wherefore this occasion offered, of verie speciall friendship he tooke his time to put
him forward, and by such wise doo him good, that all the enimies he had (except the
deuill) could neuer haue doone him so much hurt. For vpon this pages words king
Richard arose (for this communication had he sitting at the draught, a conuenient
carpet for such a councell) and came out into the pallet chamber, on which he found
in bed sir Iames and sir Thomas Tirrels, of person like, and brethren of bloud, but
nothing of kin in conditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The constable of the Tower deliuereth the keies to sir Iames Tirrell vpon the kings commandement.</div>

<p>Then said the king merilie to them; What sirs, be ye in bed so soone? And
calling vp sir Iames, brake to him secretlie his mind in this misch&eacute;euous matter.
In which he found him nothing strange. Wherefore on the morow he sent him to
Brakenberie with a letter, by which he was commanded to deliuer sir Iames all the
keies of the Tower for one night, to the end he might there accomplish the kings
pleasure, in such things as he had giuen him commandement. After which letter
deliuered, &amp; the keies receiued, sir Iames appointed the night next insuing to destroie
them, deuising before and preparing the meanes. The prince (as soone as the protector
left that name, and tooke himselfe as king) had it shewed vnto him, that he
should not reigne, but his vncle shuld haue the crowne. At which word the prince
sore abashed, began to sigh, and said: Alas, I would my vncle would let me haue

<div class="sidenote">The two murtherers of the two princes appointed.</div>

<p>Then he that told him the tale, vsed him with good words, and put him in the
best comfort he could. But foorthwith was the prince and his brother both shut
vp, &amp; all other remooued from them, onelie one (called Blacke Will, or William
Slaughter) excepted, set to serue them and s&eacute;e them sure. After which time the
prince neuer tied his points, nor ought rought of himselfe; but with that yoong
babe his brother, lingered with thought and heauinesse, vntill this traitorous death
deliuered them of that wretchednesse. For sir Iames Tirrell deuised, that they should
be murthered in their beds. To the execution whereof, he appointed Miles Forrest,
one of the foure that kept them, a fellow fleshed in murther before time. To him
he ioined one Iohn Dighton his owne horssek&eacute;eper, a big, broad, square, and strong
knaue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The yoong K. and his brother murthered in their beds at midnight in the Tower.</div>

<p>Then all the other being remooued from them, this Miles Forrest, and Iohn Dighton,
about midnight (the s&eacute;elie children lieng in their beds) came into the chamber,
&amp; suddenlie lapping them vp among the clothes, so to bewrapped them and intangled
them, k&eacute;eping downe by force the fether-bed and pillowes hard vnto their mouths,
that within a while, smoothered and stifled, their breath failing, they gaue vp to
God their innocent soules into the ioies of heauen, leauing to the tormentors their
bodies dead in the bed. Which after that the wretches perceiued, first by the
strugling with the paines of death, and after long lieng still, to be thoroughlie dead,
they laid their bodies naked out vpon the bed, and fetched sir Iames to s&eacute;e them;
which vpon the sight of them, caused those murtherers to burie them at the staire
foot, m&eacute;etlie d&eacute;epe in the ground, vnder a great heape of stones.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The murther confessed.</div>

<p>Then rode sir Iames in great hast to king Richard, and shewed him all the maner
of the murther; who gaue him great thanks, and (as some saie) there made him
knight. But he allowed not (as I haue heard) the burieng in so vile a corner,
saieng, that he would haue them buried in a better place, bicause they were a kings
sonnes. Lo the honourable courage of a king. Whervpon they saie, that a priest
of sir Robert Brakenberies tooke vp the bodies againe, and secretlie interred them
in such place, as by the occasion of his death, which onelie knew it, could neuer
since come to light. Verie truth is it, and well knowne, that at such time as
sir Iames Tirrell was in the Tower, for treason committed against the most famous
prince king Henrie the seauenth, both Dighton and he were examined, and confessed
the murther in maner aboue written: but whither the bodies were remooued,
they could nothing tell.</p>

<p>And thus (as I haue learned of them that much knew, and little cause had to lie)
were these two noble princes, these innocent tender children, borne of most roiall
bloud, brought vp in great wealth, likelie long to liue, reigne, and rule in the
realme, by traitorous tyrannie taken, depriued of their estate, shortlie shut vp in
prison, and priuilie slaine and murthered, their bodies cast God wot where, by the
cruell ambition of their vnnaturall vncle and his despiteous tormentors. Which
things on euerie part well pondered, God neuer gaue this world a more notable example,
neither in what vnsuertie standeth this worldlie weale; or what misch&eacute;efe
worketh the proud enterprise of an high heart; or finallie, what wretched end insueth
such despiteous crueltie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The iust judgement of God seuerelie reuenging the murther of the innocent princes vpon the malefactors.</div>

<p>For first, to begin with the ministers, Miles Forrest, at S. Martins p&eacute;ecemeale
rotted awaie. Dighton in d&eacute;ed yet walketh on aliue in good possibilitie to be
hanged yer he die. But sir Iames Tirrell died at the Tower hill beheaded for treason.
King Richard himselfe, as ye shall hereafter heare, slaine in the field, hacked
and hewed of his enimies hands, haried on horsse-backe dead, his haire in despite
torne and tugged like a curre dog; and the misch&eacute;efe that he tooke, within lesse
than thr&eacute;e yeares of the misch&eacute;efe that he did: and yet all (in the meane time)
spent in much paine &amp; trouble outward, much feare, anguish and sorow within. For
I haue heard by credible report of such as were secret with his chamberleine, that
after this abominable d&eacute;ed doone, he neuer had a quiet mind. Than the which
there can be no greater torment. For a giltie conscience inwardlie accusing and

<div class="sidenote">The outward and inward troubles of tyrants
by meanes of a grudging conscience.</div>

<p>He neuer thought himselfe sure. Where he went abroad, his eies whirled about,
his bodie priuilie fensed, his hand euer vpon his dagger, his countenance and maner
like one alwaies readie to strike againe, he tooke ill rest a nights, laie long waking
and musing, sore wearied with care and watch, rather slumbered than slept, troubled
with fearefull dreames, suddenlie sometime start vp, lept out of his bed, and ran
about the chamber; so was his restlesse heart continuallie tossed and tumbled with
the tedious impression and stormie remembrance of his abhominable d&eacute;ed. Now
had he outward no long time in rest. For herevpon, soone after began the conspiracie,
or rather good confederation, betw&eacute;ene the duke of Buckingham and manie
other gentlemen against him. The occasion wherevpon the king and the duke fell
out, is of diuerse folke in diuerse wise pretended.</p>

<p>This duke (as I haue for certeine b&eacute;ene informed) as soone as the duke of Glocester,
vpon the death of king Edward, came to Yorke, and there had solemne funerall
seruice for king Edward, sent thither in the most secret wise he could, one <a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>Persall
his trustie seruant, who came to Iohn Ward a chamberer of like secret trust with
the duke of Glocester, desiring that in the most close and couert maner, he might be
admitted to the presence and sp&eacute;ech of his maister. And the duke of Glocester
aduertised of his desire, caused him in the dead of the night (after all other folke
auoided) to be brought vnto him in his secret chamber, where Persall (after his
maisters recommendations) shewed him that he had secret sent him to shew him,
that in this new world he would take such part as he would, &amp; wait vpon him with
a thousand good fellowes, if n&eacute;ed were.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Persiuall, saith <i>Ed. Hall</i>.</p></div>

<p>The messenger sent backe with thanks, &amp; some secret instruction of the protectors
mind, yet met him againe with further message from the duke his master within few
daies after at Notingham: whither the protector from Yorke with manie gentlemen of
the north countrie, to the number of six hundred horsses, was come on his waie to
London-ward, &amp; after secret m&eacute;eting and communication had, eftsoones departed.
Wherevpon at Northampton, the duke met with the protector himselfe with thr&eacute;e
hundred horsses, and from thence still continued with him partner of all his deuises;
till that after his coronation, they departed (as it s&eacute;emed) verie great fr&eacute;ends at Glocester.
From whense as soone as the duke came home, he so lightlie turned from him,
and so highlie conspired against him, that a man would maruell whereof the change
grew. And suerlie, the occasion of their variance is of diuerse men diuerselie reported.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of the duke of Buckingham and K. Richards falling out.</div>

<p>Some haue I heard say, that the duke a little before his coronation, among other
things, required of the protector the duke of Herefords lands, to the which he pretended
himselfe iust inheritor. And forsomuch as the title, which he claimed by inheritance,
was somwhat interlaced with the title to the crowne by the line of king
Henrie before depriued, the protector conceiued such indignation, that he reiected the
dukes request with manie spitefull and minatorie words. Which so wounded his heart
with hatred and mistrust, that he neuer after could indure to looke aright on king
Richard, but euer feared his owne life; so far foorth, that when the protector rode
through London toward his coronation, he feined himselfe sicke, bicause he would
not ride with him. And the other also taking it in euill part, sent him word to rise,
and come ride, or he would make him be caried. Wherevpon he rode on with euill
will, and that notwithstanding on the morow, rose from the feast, feining himselfe
sicke, and king Richard said it was doone in hatred and despite of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Buckingham and king Richard mistrust each other.</div>

<p>And they said, that euer after continuallie, each of them liued in such hatred and
distrust of other, that the duke verelie looked to haue b&eacute;ene murthered at Glocester:
from which nathelesse, he in faire maner departed. But suerlie some right secret at
that daie denie this: and manie right wise men thinke it vnlikelie (the d&eacute;epe dissembling
nature of both those men considered, and what n&eacute;ed in that gr&eacute;ene world
the protector had of the duke, and in what perill the duke stood, if he fell once in suspicion
of the tyrant) that either the protector would giue the duke occasion of displeasure,
or the duke the protector occasion of mistrust. And verelie, men thinke,
that if king Richard had anie such opinion conceiued, he would neuer haue suffered
him to escape his hands. Verie truth it is, the duke was an high minded man, and
euill could beare the glorie of another; so that I haue heard of some that say they
saw it, that the duke, at such time as the crowne was first set vpon the protectors
head, his eie could not abide the sight thereof, but wried his head another
way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doctor Morton bishop of Elie, &amp; what pageants he plaied.</div>

<p>But men say, that he was of truth not well at ease, and that both to king Richard
well knowne, and not euill taken; nor anie demand of the dukes vncourteouslie reiected;
but he both with great gifts, and high behests, in most louing and trustie
maner departed at Glocester. But soone after his comming home to Brecknocke,
hauing there in his custodie by the commandement of king Richard doctor Morton
bishop of Elie, who (as ye before heard) was taken in the councell at the Tower,
waxed with him familiar, whose wisedome abused his pride to his owne deliuerance,
and the dukes destruction. The bishop was a man of great naturall wit, verie well
learned, and honorable in behauior, lacking no wise waies to win fauour. He had
b&eacute;ene fast vpon the part of king Henrie, while that part was in wealth; and nathelesse
left it not, nor forsooke it in wo, but fled the realme with the qu&eacute;ene &amp; the
prince, while king Edward had the king in prison, neuer came home, but to the
field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The high honour of doctor Morton.</div>

<p>After which lost, and that part vtterlie subdued, the other (for his fast faith and
wisedome) not onelie was content to receiue him, but also wooed him to come, and
had him from thencefoorth both in secret trust, and verie speciall fauour, which he
nothing deceiued. For he being (as y&eacute;e haue heard) after king Edwards death, first
taken by the tyrant for his truth to the king, found the meane to set this duke in his
top, ioined gentlemen togither in the aid of king Henrie, deuising first the mariage
betw&eacute;ene him &amp; king Edwards daughter: by which his faith he declared the good
seruice to both his masters at once, with infinit benefit to the realme by the coniunction
of those two blouds in one, whose seuerall titles had long disquieted the land, he
fled the realme, went to Rome, neuer minding more to meddle with the world; till the
noble prince king Henrie the seuenth gat him home againe, made him archbishop of
Canturburie, and chancellor of England, wherevnto the pope ioined the honour of
cardinall. Thus liuing manie daies in as much honor as one man might well
wish, ended them so godlie, that his death with Gods mercie well changed his
life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bishop Mortons subtill vndermining of the duke.</div>

<p>This man therefore (as I was about to tell you) by the long &amp; often alternate proofe,
as well of prosperitie as aduerse fortune, had gotten by great experience (the verie
mother and mistresse of wisedome) a d&eacute;epe insight in politike worldlie drifts.
Whereby perceiuing now this duke glad to commune with him, fed him with faire
words, and manie pleasant praises. And perceiuing by the processe of their communications,
the dukes pride now and then belking out a little breath of enuie toward
the glorie of the king, and thereby f&eacute;eling him easie to fall out if the matter were
well handled: he craftilie sought the waies to pricke him forward, taking alwaies the
occasion of his comming, and so k&eacute;eping himselfe so close within his bounds, that he
rather s&eacute;emed to follow him, than to lead him. For when the duke first began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
praise and boast the king, and shew how much profit the realme should take by his
reigne: my lord Morton answered thus.</p>

<p>Suerlie, my lord, follie were it for me to lie, for if I would sweare the contrarie,
your lordship would not (I w&eacute;ene) bel&eacute;eue; but that if the world would haue gone as
I would haue wished, king Henries sonne had had the crowne, and not king Edward.
But after that God had ordered him to l&eacute;ese it, and king Edward to reigne, I was
neuer so mad that I would with a dead man striue against the quicke. So was I to
king Edward a faithfull chapleine, &amp; glad would haue b&eacute;ene that his child had succ&eacute;eded
him. Howbeit, if the secret iudgment of God haue otherwise prouided, I
purpose not to spurne against a pricke, nor labour to set vp that God pulleth downe.
And as for the late protector and now king. And euen there he left, saieng that he
had alreadie medled too much with the world, and would from that daie meddle with
his booke and his beads, and no further.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Princes matters perillous to meddle in.</div>

<p>Then longed the duke sore to heare what he would haue said, bicause he ended with
the king, and there so suddenlie stopped, and exhorted him so familiarlie betw&eacute;ene
them twaine to be bold to saie whatsoeuer he thought; whereof he faithfullie promised
there should neuer come hurt, and peraduenture more good than he would w&eacute;ene;
and that himselfe intended to vse his faithfull secret aduise &amp; counsell, which (he said)
was the onelie cause for which he procured of the king to haue him in his custodie,
where he might reckon himselfe at home, and else had he b&eacute;ene put in the hands of
them with whome he should not haue found the like fauour. The bishop right
humblie thanked him, and said: In good faith my lord, I loue not to talke much of
princes, as a thing not all out of perill, though the word be without fault: forsomuch
as it shall not be taken as the partie ment it, but as it pleaseth the prince to construe
it.</p>

<p>And euer I thinke on Aesops tale, that when the lion had proclaimed that (on paine
of death) there should no horned beast abide in that wood: one that had in his forehed
a bunce of flesh, fled awaie a great pace. The fox that saw him run so fast, asked him
whither he made all that hast? And he answered, In faith I neither wote, nor recke, so
I were once hence, bicause of this proclamation made of horned beasts. What foole
(quoth the fox) thou maiest abide well inough: the lion ment not by th&eacute;e, for it is no
horne that is in thine head. No marie (quoth he) that wote I well inough. But
what and he call it an horne, where am I then? The duke laughed merilie at the tale,
and said; My lord, I warrant you, neither the lion nor the bore shall pike anie matter
at anie thing h&eacute;ere spoken: for it shall neuer come n&eacute;ere their eare.</p>

<p>In good faith sir (said the bishop) if it did, the thing that I was about to say, taken
as well as (afore God) I ment it, could deserue but thanke: and yet taken as I w&eacute;ene it
would, might happen to turne me to little good, and you to lesser. Then longed the
duke yet much more to wit what it was. Wherevpon the bishop said; In good faith
(my lord) as for the late protector, sith he is now king in possession, I purpose not to
dispute his title; but for the weale of this realme, whereof his grace hath now the
gouernance, and whereof I am my selfe one poore member, I was about to wish, that
to those good habilities whereof he hath alreadie right manie, little n&eacute;eding my praise,
it might yet haue pleased God, for the better store, to haue giuen him some of such
other excellent vertues, m&eacute;et for the rule of a realme, as our Lord hath planted in the
person of your grace: and there left againe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Here endeth sir <i>Thomas More</i>, &amp; this that followeth is taken out of master <i>Hall</i>.</div>

<p>The duke somewhat maruelling at his sudden pauses, as though they were but
parentheses, with a high countenance said: My lord, I euidentlie perceiue, and no
lesse note your often breathing, and sudden stopping in your communication; so that
to my intelligence, your words neither come to anie direct or perfect sentence in conclusion,
whereby either I might perceiue and haue knowledge, what your inward intent
is now toward the king, or what affection you beare toward me. For the comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
of good qualities ascribed to vs both (for the which I my selfe acknowledge and recognise
to haue none, nor looke for no praise of anie creature for the same) maketh me
not a little to muse, thinking that you haue some other priuie imagination, by loue or
by grudge, ingrauen and imprinted in your heart, which for feare you dare not, or for
childish shamefastnesse you be abashed to disclose and reueale; and speciallie to m&eacute;e
being your fr&eacute;end, which on my honor doo assure you, to be as secret in this case, as
the deafe and dumbe person is to the singer, or the tr&eacute;e to the hunter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bishop Morton buildeth vpo&#772; the dukes ambition.</div>

<p>The bishop being somewhat bolder, considering the dukes promise, but most of all
animated and incouraged bicause he knew the duke desirous to b&eacute;e exalted and magnified;
and also he perceiued the inward hatred and priuie rancor which he bare toward
king Richard: was now boldened to open his stomach euen to the verie bottome,
intending thereby to compasse how to destroie, and vtterlie confound king Richard,
and to depriue him of his dignitie roiall; else to set the duke so on fire with the desire
of ambition, that he himselfe might be safe and escape out of all danger and perill.
Which thing he brought shortlie to conclusion, both to the kings destruction, and the
dukes confusion, and to his owne safegard, and finallie to his high promotion.</p>

<p>And so (as I said before) vpon trust and confidence of the dukes promise, the
bishop said: My singular good lord, since the time of my captiuitie, which being
in your graces custodie, I may rather call it a liberall libertie, more than a streict imprisonment,
in auoiding idlenesse, mother and nourisher of all vices, in reading bookes
and ancient pamphlets I haue found this sentence written, that no man is borne fr&eacute;e,
and in libertie of himselfe onelie: for one part of dutie he oweth or should owe to his
parents for his procreation, by a verie naturall instinct and filiall courtesie: another
part to his fr&eacute;ends and kinsfolke; for proximitie of bloud and naturall amitie dooth
euerie dutie chalenge and demand: but the natiue countrie, in the which he tasted
first the sw&eacute;et aires of this pleasant and flattering world after his natiuitie, demandeth
as a debt by a naturall bond, neither to be forgotten, nor yet to be put in obliuion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Buckingham highlie commended.</div>

<p>Which saieng causeth me to consider in what case this realme my natiue countrie
now standeth, and in what estate and assurance (before this time) it hath continued:
what gouernour we now haue, and what ruler we might haue. For I plainelie perceiue
the realme being in this case, must n&eacute;eds decaie, and be brought to vtter confusion,
and finall extermination. But one hope I haue incorporat in my brest, that is, when
I consider, and in my mind doo diligentlie remember, and dailie behold your noble
personage, your iustice, and indifferencie, your feruent zeale, and ardent loue toward
your naturall countrie, and in like manner, the loue of your countrie toward you, the
great learning, pregnant wit, and goodlie eloquence, which so much dooth abound in
the person of your grace, I must n&eacute;eds thinke this realme fortunate, yea twise more
than fortunate, which hath such a prince in store, m&eacute;et and apt to be a gouernour, in whose
person (being indued with so manie princelie qualities) consisteth and resteth the verie
vndoubted similitude and image of true honour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dispraise of the lord protector or king in esse.</div>

<p>But on the other side, when I call to memorie the good qualities of the late protector
and now called king, so violated and subuerted by tyrannie, so changed and altered
by vsurped authoritie, so clouded and shadowed by blind and insatiable ambition: yea,
and so suddenlie (in manner by a metamorphosis) transformed from politike ciuilitie,
to detestable tyrannie: I must n&eacute;eds saie, &amp; iustlie affirme, that he is neither m&eacute;et to be
a king of so noble a realme, nor so famous a realme m&eacute;et to be gouerned by such a
tyrant whose kingdome (if it were of more amplenesse than it is) could not long
continue; neither would the Lord suffer him in his bloudthirstines to abuse the holie
and diuine estate of a prince by the cruell title of tyrannie. For such he will ouerthrow,
yea he will bring most horrible slaughter vpo&#772; them, as it is prophesied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>
<p>Was not his first enterprise to obteine the crowne begun and incepted by the murther
of diuerse noble, valiant true, and vertuous, personages? O holie beginning to
come to a misch&eacute;euous ending! Did he not secondarilie proc&eacute;ed (contrarie to all lawes
of honestie) shamefullie against his owne naturall mother, being a woman of much
honour and more vertue, declaring hir openlie to be a woman giuen to carnall affection,
and dissolute liuing? Which thing if it had b&eacute;ene true, as it was not ind&eacute;ed,
euerie good &amp; naturall child would haue rather mummed at it, than haue blasted it
abroad, and especiallie she being aliue. Declaring furthermore his two brethren, and
his two nephues to be bastards, and to be borne in adulterie: yet was he not with all
this content.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suspicion in a prince how misch&eacute;efous it is.</div>

<p>After that he had obteined the garland, for the which he so long thirsted, he caused the
two poore innocents his nephues, committed to him for especiall trust, to be murthered
and shamefullie to be killed. The bloud of which s&eacute;elie and litle babes dailie crie to
God from the earth for vengeance. Alas, my hart sobbeth, to remember this bloudie
butcher, and cruell monster. What suertie shall be in this realme to anie person,
either for life or goods vnder such a cruell prince, which regardeth not the destruction
of his owne bloud, and then lesse the losse of other? And most especiallie (as oftentimes
it chanceth) where a couetous or a cruell prince taketh suspicion, the smallest
swaruing that is possible (if the thing be misconstrued) may be the cause of the destruction
of manie guiltlesse persons: and in especiall of noble and wealthie personages,
hauing great possessions and riches: such a lord is Lucifer when he is entered into the
hart of a proud prince, giuen to couetousnesse and crueltie.</p>

<p>But now my lord to conclude what I meane toward your noble person, I saie and
affirme, if you loue God, your linage, or your natiue countrie, you must your selfe take
vpon you the crowne and imperiall diademe of this noble empire, both for the maintenance
of the honour of the same (which so long hath flourished in fame and renowme)
as also for the deliuerance of your naturall countrimen, from the bondage and thraldome
(woorse than the captiuitie of Aegypt) of so cruell a tyrant and arrogant oppressor.
For thus I dare saie, if anie forren prince or potentate, yea the Turke himselfe
would take vpon him the regiment here, and the crowne, the commons would
rather admit and obeie him, than to liue vnder such a bloudsucker and child-killer.
But how much more ioifull and glad would they be to liue vnder your grace, whome
they all know to be a ruler m&eacute;et and conuenient for them, and they to be louing and
obedient subiects, m&eacute;et to liue vnder such a gouernour? Despise not, nor forsake not
so manifest an occasion so louinglie offered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bishop adiureth the duke to release the realme by some deuise from the present euill state.</div>

<p>And if you your selfe, knowing the paine and trauell that apperteineth to the office of

scepter of this realme: then I adiure you, by the faith that you owe to God, by your

reduced to some suertie and conuenient regiment, vnder some good gouernour by you
to be appointed: for you are the verie patrone, the onelie helpe, refuge and comfort for
the poore amazed and desolate commons of this realme.</p>

<p>For if you could either deuise to set vp againe the linage of Lancaster, or aduance
the eldest daughter of king Edward to some high and puissant prince, not onelie the
new crowned king shall small time inioy the glorie of his dignitie; but also all ciuill
war should ceasse, all domesticall discord should sl&eacute;epe, and peace, profit and quietnesse
should be set foorth and imbraced. When the bishop had thus ended his saieng,
the duke sighed, and spake not of a great while. Which sore abashed the bishop,
and made him change colour. Which thing when the duke perceiued, he said; Be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
not afraid my lord, all promises shall be kept, to morrow we will common more: let
vs go to supper. So that night they communed no more, not a little to the disquieting
of the bishop, which now was euen as desirous to know the dukes mind and intent,
as the duke longed the daie before to know his opinion and meaning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A new confere&#772;nce betw&eacute;ene the bishop and the duke.</div>

<p>So the next daie, the duke sent for the bishop, and rehearsed to him in maner (for he
was both wittie and eloquent) all the communication had betw&eacute;ene them before, and
so paused a while, and after a little season, putting off his bonet, he said: O Lord
God creator of all things, how much is this relme of England, and the people of the
same, bounden vnto thy goodnesse! For where we now be in vexation and trouble
with great stormes oppressed, sailing and tossing in a desperate ship, without good
maister or gouernour: yet by thy helpe good Lord I trust yer long time passe, that we
shall prouide for such a ruler, as shall be both to thy pleasure, and also to the securitie
and safegard of this noble realme.</p>

<p>And then he put on his bonet, saieng to the bishop; My lord of Elie, whose true
hart and sincere affection toward me at all times I haue euidentlie perceiued and
knowen, and now most of all in our last priuie communication and secret deuising;
I must n&eacute;eds in hart thinke, and with mouth confesse and saie, that you be a
sure fr&eacute;end, a trustie councellor, a vigilant fores&eacute;er, a verie louer of your countrie, and
a naturall countrieman: for which kindnes for my part, I most louinglie render to you
my hartie thanks now with words, hereafter trusting to recompense and remunerate
you with d&eacute;eds, if life and power shall serue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke openeth himselfe and his secrets to the bishop.</div>

<p>And sith, at our last communication, you haue disclosed and opened the verie secrets
and priuities of your stomach, touching the duke of Glocester now vsurper of the
crowne; and also haue a little touched the aduancement of the two noble families of Yorke
and Lancaster: I shall likewise not onelie declare and manifest vnto you all my open acts,
attempts, and doings, but also my priuie intents, and secret cogitations. To the intent
that as you haue vnbuckeled the bouget of your priuie meanings, and secret purposes
to me: so shall all my cloudie workings, close deuises, and secret imaginations
be (as cl&eacute;ere as the sunne) reuealed, opened, and made lightsome to you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke complaineth of want of preferment in king Edwards daies.</div>

<p>And to begin, I declare, that when king Edward was deceassed, to whome I thought
my selfe little or nothing beholden (although we two had maried two sisters) bicause
he neither promoted, nor preferred me, as I thought I was worthie, and had deserued;
neither fauoured nor regarded me, according to my degr&eacute;e and birth (for suerlie I had
by him little authoritie, and lesse rule, and in effect nothing at all: which caused me
lesse to fauour his children, bicause I found small humanitie, or none in their parent) I
then began to studie, and with ripe deliberation to ponder and consider, how and in
what manner this realme should be ruled and gouerned. And first I remembred an old
prouerbe worthie of memorie, that often rueth the realme where children rule, and
women gouerne.</p>

<p>This old adage so sanke and settled in my head, that I thought it a great errour, and
extreame mischiefe to the whole realme, either to suffer the yoong king to rule, or the
qu&eacute;ene his mother to be a gouernesse ouer him, considering that hir brethren, and hir
first children (although they were not extract of high and noble linage) tooke more
vpon them, and more exalted themselues, by reason of the qu&eacute;ene, than did the kings
brethren, or anie duke in his realme: which in conclusion turned to their confusion.
Then I being persuaded with my selfe in this point, thought it necessarie both for the
publike and profitable wealth of this realme, and also for mine owne commoditie and
emolument, to take part with the duke of Glocester; whom (I assure you) I thought
to be as cleane without dissimulation, as tractable without iniurie, as mercifull without
crueltie; as now I know him perfectlie to be a dissembler without veritie, a tyrant
without pitie, yea &amp; worse than the tyrant Phalaris, destitute of all truth and clemencie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<p>And so by my meanes, at the first councell holden at London, when he was most
suspected of that thing that after happened (as you my lord know well inough) he
was made protector and defendor both of the king and of the realme, which authoritie
once gotten, &amp; the two children partlie by <a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>policie brought vnder his gouernance, he
being mooued with that gnawing and couetous serpent desire to reigne, neuer ceassed
priuilie to exhort and require, yea and sometimes with minatorie tearmes to persuade me
and other lords, as well spirituall as temporall, that he might take vpon him the
crowne, till the prince came to the age of foure and twentie yeares, and were able to
gouerne the realme, as a ripe and sufficient king.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> An vnhappie policie tending to slaughter &amp; bloudshed.</p></div>

<p>Which thing when he saw me somewhat sticke at, both for the strangenesse of
the example (bicause no such president had b&eacute;ene s&eacute;ene) and also bicause we remembred
that men once ascended to the highest type of honour and authoritie,
will not gladlie descend againe; he then brought in instruments, autentike doctors,
proctors, and notaries of the law, with depositions of diuerse witnesses, testifieng
king Edwards children to be bastards. Which depositions then I thought to be as true,
as now I know them to be feined; and testified by persons with rewards vntrulie
suborned. When the said depositions were before vs read and diligentlie heard, he
stood vp bareheaded, saieng: Well my lords, euen as I and you (sage and discr&eacute;et
councellors) would that my nephue should haue no wrong; so I preie you doo me
nothing but right. For these witnesses &amp; saiengs of famous doctors being true, I am
onelie the vndubitate heire to lord Richard Plantagenet duke of Yorke, adiudged to
be the verie heire to the crowne of this relme by authoritie of parlement.</p>

<p>Which things so by learned men to vs for a veritie declared, caused me and other
to take him for our lawfull and vndoubted prince and souereigne lord. For well we
knew that the duke of Clarence sonne, by reason of the atteindor of his father, was
disabled to inherit; and also the duke himselfe was named to be a bastard, as I my
selfe haue heard spoken, and that vpon great presumptions more times than one: so
againe, by my aid and fauour, he of a protector was made a king, and of a subiect made a
gouernor. At which time he promised me on his fidelitie (laieng his hand in mine at
Bainards castell) that the two yoong princes should liue, and that he would so prouide
for them and so mainteine them in honorable estate, that I and all the realme ought
and should be content. But his words wanted weight, which is a foule discredit to
a prince, to a p&eacute;ere, yea to a priuat and meane common man, as testifieth this sentence:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dedecus est rebus cum bona verba carent.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">The principall cause why the duke of Buckingham co&#772;nceiued such inward grudge against king Richard.</div>

<p>For when he was once crowned king, and in full possession of the whole realme,
he cast awaie his old conditions as the adder dooth hir skin, verifieng the old prouerbe;
Honours change manners, as the parish pr&eacute;est remembreth that he was neuer parish
clearke. For when I my selfe sued vnto him for my part of the earle of Herefords
lands which his brother king Edward wrongfullie deteined and withheld from me;
and also required to haue the office of the high constableship of England, as diuerse
of my noble ancestors before this time haue had, and in long descent continued: in
this my first sute shewing his good mind toward me; he did not onelie first delaie me,
and afterward denaie me, but gaue me such vnkind words, with such tawnts &amp; retawnts,
ye in manner checke and checkemate, to the vttermost proofe of my patience:
as though I had neuer furthered him, but hindered him; as though I had put him
downe, and not set him vp.</p>

<p>Yet all these ingratitudes and vndeserued vnkindnesses I bare closelie, &amp; suffered
patientlie, and couertlie remembred, outwardlie dissembling that I inwardlie thought:
and so with a painted countenance, I passed the last summer in his last companie, not
without manie faire promises, but without anie good d&eacute;eds. But when I was crediblie
informed of the death of the two yoong innocents, his owne naturall nephues contrarie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>to his faith and promise, to the which (God be my iudge) I neuer agr&eacute;ed, nor
condescended; O Lord, how my veines panted, how my bodie trembled, and how my
heart inwardlie grudged! insomuch that I so abhorred the sight, and much more the
companie of him, that I could no longer abide in his court, except I should be openlie
reuenged: the end whereof was doubtfull. And so I feined a cause to depart, and
with a merrie countenance and a despitefull heart I tooke my leaue humblie of him (he
thinking nothing lesse than that I was displeased) and so returned to Brecknocke to
you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The imaginations of the duke of Buckingham to depriue K. Richard.</div>

<p>But in that iournie (as I returned) whither it were by the inspiration of the Holie-ghost,
or by melancholious disposition, I had diuerse and sundrie imaginations how to
depriue this vnnaturall vncle, and bloudie butcher, from his roiall seat, and princelie
dignitie. First I fantised, that if I list to take vpon me the crowne, and imperiall
scepter of the realme, now was the time propice and conuenient. For now was the
waie made plaine, and the gate opened, and occasion giuen: which now neglected,
should peraduenture neuer take such effect and conclusion. For I saw he was disdeined
of the lords temporall, abhored and accurssed of the lords spirituall, detested of all
gentlemen, and despised of all the communaltie: so that I saw my chance as perfectlie
as I saw mine owne image in a glasse, that there was no person (if I had b&eacute;en gr&eacute;edie to
attempt the enterprise) could nor should haue woone the ring, or got the gole before
me. And on this point I rested in imagination secretlie with my selfe two daies
at Tewkesburie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the working of ambition in the duke.</div>

<p>From thence so iournieng, I mused and thought that it was not best nor conuenient
to take vpon me as a conqueror. For then I knew that all men, and especiallie the
nobilitie, would with all their power withstand me, both for rescuing of possessions
and tenures, as also for subuerting of the whole estate, laws and customes of the
realme: such a power hath a conqueror, as you know well inough my lord. But at
the last, in all this doubtfull case there sprang a new branch out of my head, which
suerlie I thought should haue brought forth faire floures; but the sunne was so hot,
that they turned to drie w&eacute;eds. For I suddenlie remembred that the lord Edmund
duke of Summerset my grandfather, was with king Henrie the sixt in the two and
thr&eacute;e degr&eacute;es, from Iohn duke of Lancaster lawfullie begotten: so that I thought
sure, my mother being eldest daughter to duke Edmund, that I was next heire to king
Henrie the sixt of the house of Lancaster.</p>

<p>This title pleased well such as I made priuie of my counsell, but much more it
incouraged my foolish desire, and eleuated my ambitious intent; insomuch that I
cl&eacute;erelie iudged, and in mine owne mind was determinatlie resolued, that I was indubitate
heire of the house of Lancaster, and therevpon concluded to make my first
foundation, and erect my new building. But whether God so ordeined, or by fortune
it so chanced, while I was in a maze either to conclude suddenlie on this title, &amp; to
set it open amongst the common people, or to k&eacute;epe it secret a while, s&eacute;e the chance:
as I rode betw&eacute;ene Worcester and Bridgenorth, I incountered with the ladie Margaret
countesse of Richmond, now wife vnto the lord Stanlie, which is the verie daughter
and sole heire to lord Iohn duke of Summerset, my grandfathers elder brother, which
was as cleane out of my mind, as though I had neuer s&eacute;ene hir: so that she and hir
sonne the earle of Richmond be both bulworke and portcullice betw&eacute;ene me and the
gate, to enter into the maiestie roiall and getting of the crowne.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">The office of a king verie hard to discharge.</div>

<p>Now when we had communed a little concerning hir sonne, as I shall shew you
after, and were departed, sh&eacute;e to our ladie of Worcester, and I to Shrewsburie: I
then new changed, and in maner amazed, began to dispute with my selfe, little
considering that thus my earnest title was turned to a tittell not so good as Est Amen.
Eftsoones I imagined whether were best to take vpon me, by election of the nobilitie
and communaltie, which me thought easie to be done, the vsurper king thus being in
hatred and abhorred of this whole realme; or to take it by power, which, standeth in
fortunes chance, and difficile to be atchiued and brought to passe. Thus tumbling
and tossing in the waues of ambiguitie, betw&eacute;ene the stone and the sacrifice, I
considered first, the office, dutie, and paine of a king, which suerlie thinke I that no
mortall man can iustlie and trulie obserue, except he be called, elected, and speciallie
appointed by God as K. Dauid, and diuerse other haue b&eacute;ene.</p>

<p>But further, I remembred that if I once tooke on me the scepter, and the gouernance
of the realme; that of two extreame enimies I was dailie sure, but of one trustie
friend (which now a daies be gone a pilgrimage) I was neither assured nor crediblie
ascerteined; such is the worlds mutation. For I manifestlie perceiued, that the
daughters of king Edward, and their alies and fr&eacute;ends, which be no small number,
being both for his sake much beloued, and also for the great iniurie &amp; manifest tyrannie
doone to them by the new vsurper, much lamented and pitied, would neuer ceasse to
barke if they cannot bite at the one side of me. Semblablie, my coosine the earle
of Richmond, his aids and kinsfolks, which be not of little power, will suerlie
attempt like a fierce greihound, either to bite or to pearse me on the other side. So
that my life and rule should euer hang by a haire, neuer in quiet, but euer in doubt of
death, or deposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dukes resolution not to medle in s&eacute;eking to obteine the crowne.</div>

<p>And if the said two linages of Yorke and Lancaster, which so long haue striued
for the imperiall diadem, should ioine in one against me, then were I suerlie mated,
and the game gotten. Wherefore I haue cl&eacute;erelie determined, and with my selfe
concluded, vtterlie to relinquish all such fantasticall imaginations, concerning the
obteining of the crowne. But all such plagues, calamities and troubles, which I
feared and suspected might haue chanced on me if I had taken the rule and regiment
of this realme, I shall with a reredemaine so make them rebound to our common
enimie that calleth himselfe king, that the best stopper that he hath at tenice shall
not well stop without a fault.</p>

<p>For (as I told you before) the countesse of Richmond in my returne from the new
named king, m&eacute;eting me in the high waie, praied me first for kindred sake, secondarilie
for the loue that I bare to my grandfather duke Humfrie, which was sworne brother to
hir father, to mooue the king to be good to hir sonne Henrie earle of Richmond, and
to licence him with his fauour to returne againe into England. And if it were his
pleasure so to doo, she promised that the earle hir sonne should marrie one of king
Edwards daughters, at the appointment of the king, without anie thing to be taken
or demanded for the said espousals, but onelie the kings fauour; which request I soone
ouerpassed, and gaue hir faire words, and so departed.</p>

<p>But after in my lodging, when I called to memorie with a deliberate studie, and
did circumspectlie ponder them, I fullie adiudged, that the Holie-ghost caused hir to
mooue a thing (the end whereof she could not consider) both for the securitie of the
realme, as also for the preferment of hir child, and the destruction and finall confusion
of the common enimie king Richard. Which thing, she neither then thought (I
am sure) as I by hir words could make coniecture, nor I my selfe cast not hir desire to
be so profitable to the realme as I now doo perceiue. But such a Lord is God, that
with a little sparkle he kindleth a great fire, and (to the admiration of the world) of
impossibilities he maketh possibilities, of small beginnings mightie increasings, of
drops great flouds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Buckingham resolued to helpe to depose king Richard, and to

<p>And so finallie to declare to you the verie conclusion to the which I am both bent

verie heire of the house of Lancaster (in the quarrell of the which linage, both my
father and grandfather lost their liues in battell) shall take to wife ladie Elizabeth
eldest daughter to king Edward, by the which mariage both the houses of Yorke

<div class="sidenote">The summe of the dukes purpose.</div>

<p>This inuention of the duke manie men thought after, that it was more imagined
for the inward hatred that he bare to king Richard, than for anie fauor that he bare to
the earle of Richmond. But of such doubtfull matter it is not best to iudge, for
erring too farre from the mind and intent of the author. But what soeuer he intended,
this deuise once opened to king Richard was the verie occasion, that he was rounded
shorter by the whole head, without attaindor or iudgement. When the duke had said,
the bishop which fauoured euer the house of Lancaster, was woonderous ioifull, and
much reioised to heare this deuise. For now came the wind about euen as he would
haue it, sith all his imagination tended to this effect, to haue king Richard subdued,
and to haue the lines of king Edward, and king Henrie the sixt againe raised and
aduanced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The motion for the coniunction of the two houses of Lancaster
&amp; Yorke (deuised by the duke) furthered.</div>

<p>But lord how he reioised, to thinke how that by this marriage the linages of Yorke
and Lancaster should be conioined in one, to the verie stedfastnesse of the publike
wealth of this realme. And least the dukes courage should swage, or his mind should
againe alter, as it did often before (as you may easilie perceiue by his owne tale) he
thought to set vp all the sailes that he had, to the intent that the ship of his pretended
purpose might come shortlie to some sure port, and said to the duke: My lord, sith
by Gods prouision and your incomparable wisedome and policie, this noble coniunction
is first mooued, now is it conuenient, yea and necessarie, to consider what personages,
and what fr&eacute;ends we shall first make priuie of this high deuise and politike conclusion:
[which is not rashlie &amp; without aduisement to be aduentured, for therin is
danger, as the wiseman saith:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Semper habet damnum mentis temerarius ardor.]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By my truth, quoth the duke, we will begin with the ladie Richmond, the
earles mother, which knoweth where he is, either in captiuitie, or at large in Britaine.
For I heard saie, that the duke of Britaine restored him to libertie, immediatlie
after the death of king Edward, by whose means he was restreined. Sith you
will begin that waie (said the bishop) I haue an old fr&eacute;end with the countesse, a man
sober, secret, and well witted, called Reginald Braie: whose prudent policie I haue
knowne to haue compassed things of great importance, for whome I shall secretlie
send, if it be your pleasure; and I doubt not but he will gladlie come and that with
a good will. So with a little diligence the bishop wrote a letter to Reginald Braie, requiring
him to come to Brecknocke with sp&eacute;ed, for great and vrgent causes touching
his mistresse: and no other thing was declared in the letter. So the messenger rode
into Lancashire where Braie was with the countesse, and lord Thomas Stanlie hir husband,
and deliuered the letter: which when he had read, he tooke it as a signe or presage
of some good fortune to come.</p>

<p>Then he (with the messenger) came to the castell of Brecknocke, where the duke
and the bishop declared what thing was deuised, both for to set the relme in a quiet
stedfastnesse, as also for the high preferment of the earle of Richmond, sonne to his
ladie and mistresse: willing hir first to compasse how to obteine the good will of
qu&eacute;ene Elizabeth, and also of hir eldest daughter bearing the same name: and after
secretlie to send to hir sonne into Britaine, to declare what high honor was prepared
for him, if he would sweare to marrie the ladie Elizabeth assoone as he was king,
and in roiall possession of the relme. Reginald Braie with a glad heart, forgetting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>nothing giuen to him in charge, in great hast and with good sp&eacute;ed returned to the
countesse his ladie and mistresse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bishop Mortons deuise for to be
at his owne libertie in his bishoprike of Elie.</div>

<p>When Braie was departed, and this great doubtfull vessell once set abroach, the
bishop thirsting for nothing more than for libertie: when he saw the duke pleasant
and well minded toward him; he told the duke, that if he were in his Ile of Elie, he
could make manie fr&eacute;ends to further their enterprise: and if he were there and had
but foure daies warning, he little regarded the malice of king Richard, his countrie
was so strong. The duke knew well all this to be true, but yet loth he was that the
bishop should depart: for he knew well, that as long as the bishop was with him, he
was sure of politike aduise, sage counsell, and circumspect proc&eacute;eding. And so he
gaue the bishop faire words, saieng, that he should shortlie depart, and that well accompanied
for feare of enimies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bishop of Elie saileth into
Flanders to the earle of Richmond.</div>

<p>The Bishop being as wittie as the duke was wilie, did not tarrie till the dukes companie
were assembled, but secretlie disguised, in a night departed (to the dukes great
displeasure) and came to his s&eacute;e of Elie; where he found monie and fr&eacute;ends; and so
sailed into Flanders, where he did the earle of Richmond good seruice, and neuer returned
againe, till the erle of Richmond (after being king) sent for him, and shortlie
promoted him to the s&eacute;e of Canturburie. Thus the bishop woond himselfe from the
duke when he had most n&eacute;ed of his aid, for if he had taried still, the duke had not
made so manie blabs of his counsell, nor put so much confidence in the Welshmen,
nor yet so temerariouslie set forward (without knowledge of his fr&eacute;ends) as he did,
which things were his sudden ouerthrowe (as they that knew it did report) [and
might perhaps haue b&eacute;ene auoided by the bishops wisdome for the dukes saftie, as his
owne; sith</p>

</div></div>

<p>When Reginald Braie had declared his message and priuie instruction to the countesse
of Richmond his mistresse, no maruell though she were ioious and glad, both of
the good newes, and also for the obteining of such a high fr&eacute;end in hir sonnes cause
as the duke was. Wherefore she willing not to sl&eacute;epe this matter, but to further it
to the vttermost of hir power and abilitie, deuised a means how to breake this matter
to qu&eacute;ene Elizabeth then being in sanctuarie at Westminster. And therevpon she,
hauing in hir familie at that time (for the preseruation of hir health) a certeine
Welshman called Lewes, learned in physicke, which for his grauitie and experience,
was well knowne, and much est&eacute;emed amongest great estates of the realme, brake
hir mind to him.</p>

<p>For with this Lewes she vsed sometime liberallie and familiarlie to talke, and now
hauing opportunitie and occasion to expresse hir hart vnto him in this weightie matter,
declared that the time was come that hir sonne should be ioined in marriage with ladie

and required him to go to qu&eacute;ene Elizabeth (with whome in his facultie he was
of counsell) not as a messenger, but as one that came fr&eacute;endlie to visit and consolate

<p>This physician did not linger to accomplish hir desire, but with good diligence repaired
to the qu&eacute;ene, being still in the sanctuarie at Westminster. And when he saw
time propice and conuenient for his purpose, he said vnto hir: Madame, although my
imagination be verie simple, and my deuise more foolish; yet for the entire affection
that I beare toward you and your children, I am so bold to vtter vnto you a secret
and priuie conceit that I haue cast and compassed in my fantasticall braine. When I
well remembred and no lesse considered the great losse and damage that you haue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
susteined, by the death of your noble and louing husband; and the great dolour and
sorow that you haue suffered and tollerated, by the cruell murther of your innocent
children: I can no lesse doo both of bounden duetie and christian charitie, than dailie

<div class="sidenote">The coniunction of the two families mooued to the Q. by the physician.</div>

<p>And first consider, what battell, what manslaughter, what misch&eacute;efe hath risen in

Which two families (as I haue continued) if they may be ioined in one, I thinke, yea
and doubt not, but your line shall be againe restored to the pristinate estate and degr&eacute;e;
to your great ioie and comfort, and to the vtter confusion of your mortall enimie
the vsurper king. You know verie well madame, that of the house of Lancaster,
the earle of Richmond is next of bloud, who is liuing, and a lustie yoong batcheler,
and to the house of Yorke your daughters now are heires. If you could agr&eacute;e and
inuent the meane how to couple your eldest daughter with the yoong earle of Richmond

and your heire againe to hir right restored.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The qu&eacute;enes readinesse to set forward this co&#772;clusion.</div>

<p>When the qu&eacute;ene had heard this friendlie motion (which was as farre from hir
thought, as the man that the rude people saie is in the moone) lord how hir spirits
reuiued, and how hir heart leapt in hir bodie for ioie and gladnesse! And first giuing
laud to Almightie God, as the chiefe authour of hir comfort, secondarilie to maister
Lewes, as the deuiser of these good newes &amp; tidings, she instantlie besought him, that
as he had b&eacute;ene the first inuenter of so great an enterprise, so now he would not relinquish
nor desist to follow the same: requiring him further (bicause he was apperteining
to the countesse of Richmond mother to the erle Henrie) that he would with
all diligent celeritie resort to hir, then lodging in hir husbands place, within the
citie of London: and to declare on the qu&eacute;enes behalfe to the countesse, that all the
friends and fautors of king Edward hir husband, should assist and take part with
the earle of Richmond hir sonne, so that he would take a corporall oth after the kingdome
obteined, to espouse and take to wife the ladie Elizabeth hir daughter, or else
ladie Cicilie, if the eldest daughter were not then liuing.</p>

<p>Maister Lewes with all dexteritie so sped his businesse, that he made and concluded
a finall end and determination of this enterprise betwene the two mothers. And bicause
he was a physician, and out of all suspicion and misd&eacute;eming, he was the common
curror and dailie messenger betw&eacute;ene them, aiding and setting foorth the inuented
conspiracie against king Richard. So the ladie Margaret countesse of Richmond,
brought into a good hope of the preferment of hir sonne, made Reginald Braie hir
most faithfull seruant, chiefe sollicitor and priuie procuror of this conspiracie; giuing
him in charge secretly to inuegle and attract such persons of nobilitie to ioine with
hir and take hir part, as he knew to be ingenious, faithfull, diligent, and of actiuitie.
This Reginald Braie within few daies brought vnto his lure (first of all taking of
euerie person a solemne oth to be true and secret) sir Giles Daubneie, sir Iohn Cheinie
knight, Richard Gilford, and Thomas Rame esquiers, and diuers other. The countesse
of Richmond was not so diligent for hir part, but qu&eacute;ene Elizabeth was as vigilant
on the other side, and made friends, and appointed councellors to set forward and
aduance hir businesse.</p>

confidence and truth, that he all his life had fauoured and taken part with king Henrie
the sixt, and as a speciall iewell put to hir seruice by sir Lewes hir physician. So

suddenlie she remembring that the duke of Buckingham was one of the first inuentors,
and a secret founder of this enterprise, determined to send some personage of more estimation
than hir chapleine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hugh Co&#772;weie esquire sent ouer to the earle of Richmond, to informe him of his roiall preferment.</div>

<p>Herevpon she elected for a messenger Hugh Conweie esquier, &amp; sent him into Britaine
with a great sum of monie to hir sonne, giuing him in charge, to declare to the
earle the great loue and especiall fauor that the most part of the nobilitie of the
realme bare toward him, the louing hearts &amp; beneuolent minds which the whole communaltie
of their owne fr&eacute;e will frankelie offered, and liberallie exhibited to him, willing
and aduising him not to neglect so good an occasion apparantlie offered; but
with all sp&eacute;ed and diligence, to addict and settle his mind &amp; full intention how to returne
home againe into England, where he was both wished and looked for: giuing
him further monition and counsell, to take land and arriuall in the principalitie of
Wales, where he should not doubt to find both aid, comfort and friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tho. Rame sent ouer for the same purpose for feare of interception.</div>

<p>Richard Gilford, least Hugh Conweie might fortune to be taken, or stopped at
Plimmouth, where he intended to take his nauigation, sent out of Kent Thomas
Rame with the same instructions: and both made such diligence, and had such wind
and weather, the one by land from Calis, and the other by water from Plimmouth,
that within lesse than an houre both ariued in the duke of Britains court, and spake
with the earle of Richmond, which (from the death of king Edward) went at pleasure
and libertie, and to him counted and manifested the cause and effect of their message
and ambassage. When the earle had receiued this message (which was the more pleasant,
bicause it was vnlooked for) he rendered to Iesu his sauiour, his most humble &amp;
heartie thanks, being in firme credence and bel&eacute;efe, that such things as h&eacute;e with busie
mind and laborious intent had wished &amp; desired, could neuer haue taken anie effect,
without the helpe and preferment of almightie God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Richmond maketh the duke of Britaine priuie to the matter.</div>

<p>And now being put in comfort of his long longing, he did communicate &amp; breake
to the duke of Britaine all his secrets, and priuie messages, which were to him declared:
aduertising him that he was entered into a sure and stedfast hope, to obteine
and get the crowne and kingdome of the realme of England, desiring him both of
his good will and friendlie helpe toward the atchiuing of his offered enterprise, promising
him when he came to his intended purpose, to render to him againe equall kindnes,
and condigne recompense. Although the duke of Britaine before that daie, by Thomas
Hutton ambassadour from king Richard, had both by monie and praiers b&eacute;ene solicited
and mooued to put againe into safe custodie the earle of Richmond, he
neuerthelesse promised faithfullie to aid him: and his promise h&eacute;e trulie performed.</p>

intent that all things, which by counsell might be for his purpose prouided, should be
sp&eacute;edilie and diligentlie doone; and that all things doubtfull, should of his friends be
prudentlie fores&eacute;ene, in auoiding all engines or snares which king Richard had or
might set in disturbance of his purpose: and he in the meane season would make his
abode still in Britaine, till all things necessarie for his iournie were prepared, and
brought in a readinesse. In the meane season, the chiefteins of the coniuration in
England began togither manie enterprises: some in conuenient fortresses put strong
garrisons, some kept armed men priuilie, to the intent that when they should haue
knowledge of the earles landing, they would begin to stir vp the war: other did secretlie
mooue and solicit the people to rise &amp; make an insurrection: other (amongst
whom Iohn Morton bishop of Elie then being in Flanders was chiefe) by priuie letters
and cloked messengers did stirre and mooue to this new coniuration, all such which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
they certeinlie knew to haue a rooted hatred, or to beare cankered malice toward king

<div class="sidenote">K. Richards purpose in the case of coniuration against him.</div>

<p>Although this great enterprise were neuer so priuilie handled, and so secretlie
amongst so circumspect persons treated, compassed and conueied; yet knowledge
therof came to the eares of king Richard, who with the sudden chance was not a
little mooued and astonied. First bicause he had no host readie prepared; secondlie,
if he should raise an armie so suddenlie, he knew not where to m&eacute;et his enimies, or
whither to go, or where to tarrie. Wherefore he determined to dissemble the matter
as though he knew nothing, till he had assembled his host; and in the meane season
either by the rumour of the common people, or by the diligence of his espials to
search out all the counsels, determinations, intents, and compasses of his close
aduersaries; or else by policie to intercept and take some person of the same coniuration,
considering that there is no more secret nor hid espiall, than that which lurketh in
dissimulation of knowledge and intelligence, or is hidden in name and shadow of
counterfeit humanitie and feined kindnesse. But yet wisedome hath a deuise to auoid
&amp; shift off all such deceiuers, as the poet well saieth:</p>

</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Buckingham conspireth against king Richard.</div>

<p>And bicause he knew the duke of Buckingham to be the chiefe head and aid of the
coniuration, h&eacute;e thought it most necessarie to plucke him from that part, either by
faire promises or open warre. Wherevpon he addressed his louing letters to the duke,
full of gentle words, &amp; most friendlie speach; giuing further in charge to the messenger
that caried the letter to promise the duke (in his behalfe) golden hilles, and
siluer riuers, and with all gentle and pleasant means to persuade and exhort the duke
to come to the court. But the duke as wilie as the king, mistrusting the faire flattering
words, and the gaie promises to him so suddenlie without any cause offered, knowing
the craftie casts of king Richards bow, which in diuerse affaires before time he
had s&eacute;ene practised, required the king to pardon him, excusing himselfe that he was
so diseased in his stomach, that scant he could either take refection or rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Buckingham a professed enimie to king Richard.</div>

<p>King Richard not being content with this excuse would in no wise admit the same;
but incontinent directed to the duke other letters, of a more rougher and hautier sort,
not without tawnting and biting tearmes, and checking words, commanding him (all
excuses set apart) to repaire without anie delaie to his roiall presence. The duke made
to the messeng a determinate answer, that he would not come to his mortall enimie,
whome he neither loued, nor fauoured: and immediatlie prepared open warre against
him, and persuaded all his complices and partakers, that euerie man in his quarter,
with all diligence should raise vp people &amp; make a commotion. And by this means
almost in one moment Thomas marques Dorset came out of sanctuarie, where since
the begining of K. Richards daies he had continued, whose life by the onelie helpe of sir
Thomas Louell was preserued from all danger &amp; perill in this troublous world, gathered
togither a great band of men in Yorkeshire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">K. Richards drift in the disposing of his armie.</div>

<p>Sir Edward Courtneie, and Peter his brother bishop of Excester, raised an other
armie in Deuonshire and Cornewall. In Kent Richard Gilford and other gentlemen
collected a great companie of souldiers, and openlie began warre. But king Richard,
who in the meane time had gotten togither a great strength and puissance, thinking it
not most for his part beneficiall, to disperse and diuide his great armie into small
branches, and particularlie to persecute anie one of the coniuration by himselfe, determined
(all other things being set aside) with his whole puissance to set on the chiefe
head, which was the duke of Buckingham. And so remoouing from London, he
tooke his iournie towards Salisburie, to the intent that in his iournie he might set on
the dukes armie, if he might know him in anie place incamped, or in order of battell
arraied.</p>

<p>The king was scarse two daies iournie from Salisburie, when the duke of Buckingham
accompanied with a great power of wild Welshmen, whom he (being a man of
great courage and sharpe sp&eacute;ech) in maner against their willes had rather thereto inforced
and compelled by lordlie and streict commandement, than by liberall wages and
gentle demenour, which thing was the verie occasion why they left him desolate, &amp;
cowardlie forsooke him. The duke with all his power marched through the forrest
of Deane, intending to haue passed the riuer Seuerne at Glocester, &amp; there to haue
ioined his armie with the Courtneis, and other westerne men of his confederacie and
affinitie. Which if he doone, no doubt but king Richard had b&eacute;ene in great ieopardie,
either of priuation of his realme, or losse of his life, or both.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A sore floud of

<p>But s&eacute;e the chance. Before he could atteine to Seuerne side, by force of continuall
raine and moisture, the riuer rose so high that it ouerflowed all the countrie adioining,
insomuch that men were drowned in their beds, and houses with the extreame violence
were ouerturned, children were caried about the fields swimming in cradels,
beasts were drowned on hilles. Which rage of water lasted continuallie ten daies,
insomuch that in the countrie adioining they call it to this daie, The great water; or
the duke of Buckinghams great water. By this floud the passages were so closed, that
neither the duke could come ouer Seuern to his adherents, nor they to him. During
the which time, the Welshmen lingring idelie, and without monie, vittels, or wages,
suddenlie scattered and departed: and for all the dukes faire promises, threatnings,
and inforcement, would in no wise either go further nor abide.</p>

<p>The duke (being thus left almost post alone) was of necessitie compelled to flie, and
in flight was with this sudden fortune maruellouslie dismaid: and being vnpurneied
what counsell he should take, and what waie he should follow, like a man in despaire,
not knowing what to doo, of verie trust &amp; confidence conueied himselfe into the house
of Humfreie Banaster his seruant beside Shrewesburie, whome he had tenderlie
brought vp, and whome he aboue all men loued, fauoured and trusted; now not
doubting but that in his extreame necessitie he should find him faithfull, secret, and
trustie, intending there couertlie to lurke, till either he might raise againe a new
armie, or else shortlie to saile into Britaine to the earle of Richmond. [But alas
(good duke) the meanes (by occasion of Gods prouidence, shaking men out of their
shifts of supposed safetie) failed him, and he fell infortunatlie into the hands of the

they were suddenlie amazed &amp; striken with sudden feare, that euery man like persons
desperate shifted for himselfe &amp; fled. Some went to sanctuarie, and to solitarie places;
some fled by sea, whereof the most part within a few daies after arriued safelie in the
duchie of Britaine. Among which number were these persons; Peter Courtneie
bishop of Excester, and sir Edmund Courtneie his brother, by king Henrie the seuenth

but also that he was readie to aid and succour the said earle, with men, monie and all

ships of warre, well furnished and decked with men and artillerie, to scowre and
k&eacute;epe that part of the sea that lieth ouer against Britaine, to the intent that if the
earle of Richmond would aduenture to saile toward England, either he should be
taken captiue, or be beaten and driuen from the coast of England. And moreouer, to
the intent that euerie coast, waie, passage, and corner, should be diligentlie watched

<p>While this busie search was diligentlie applied and put in execution, Humfreie
Banaster (were it more for feare of life and losse of goods, or allured &amp; prouoked by
auaricious desire of the thousand pounds) he bewraied his guest and maister to
Iohn Mitton then shiriffe of Shropshire; which suddenlie with a strong power of men
in harnesse apprehended the duke in a little groue adioining to the mansion of
Humfreie Banaster, and in great hast and euill sp&eacute;ed conueied him apparelled in a
pilled blacke cloake to the towne of Shrewesburie, where king Richard then kept his
houshold. Whether this Banaster bewraried the duke more for feare than couetous,
manie men doo doubt: but sure it is, that shortlie after he had betraied the duke his
master; his sonne and heire waxed mad, &amp; so died in a bores stie; his eldest daughter
of excellent beautie, was suddenlie striken with a foule leprosie; his second sonne
maruellouslie deformed of his lims, and made lame; his yoonger sonne in a small puddle
was strangled and drowned; and he being of extreame age, arreigned, and found
guiltie of a murther, and by his cleargie saued. And as for his thousand pounds,
K. Richard gaue him not one farthing, saieng that he which would be vntrue to so good
a maister, would be false to all other: howbeit some saie that he had a small office or
a farme to stop his mouth withall. The duke being by certeine of the kings councell
diligentlie vpon interrogatories examined, what things he knew preiudiciall vnto the
kings person, opened and declared franklie and fr&eacute;elie all the coniuration, without
dissembling or glosing; trusting, bicause he had trulie and plainelie reuealed and
confessed all things that were of him required, that he should haue licence to speake
to the king: which (whether it were to sue for pardon and grace, or whether he
being brought to his presence, would haue sticked him with a dagger as men then
iudged) he sore desired and required. But when he had confessed the whole fact &amp;
conspiracie, vpon All soules daie, without arreigment or iudgement, he was at Salisburie
in the open market place, on a new scaffold beheaded and put to death.</p>

<p>This death (as a reward) the duke of Buckingham receiued at the hands of king
Richard, whome he before in his affaires, purposes and enterprises had holpen, susteined,
and set forward, aboue all Gods forbode. By this all men may easilie perceiue,
that he not onelie loseth both his labour, trauell, and industrie (and further staineth and
spotteth his line with a perpetuall ignominie and reproch) which in euill and mischiefe
assisteth and aideth an euill disposed person, considering for the most part, that

ire of blustering wind was some deale appeased; about the houre of noone the same
daie, the earle approched to the south part of the realme of England, euen at the
mouth of the hauen of Pole, in the countie of Dorset, where he might plainelie perceiue
all the sea bankes &amp; shores garnished and furnished with men of warre and
souldiers, appointed and deputed there to defend his arriuall and landing (as before is
mentioned.) Wherefore he gaue streict charge, and sore commandement, that no person
should once presume to take land, and go to shore, vntill such time as the whole
nauie were assembled and come togither. And while he taried and lingered, he sent
out a shipboate toward the land side, to know whether they, which stood there in such
a number, and so well furnished in apparell defensiue were his foes and enimies, or else,
his fr&eacute;ends and comfortors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A forged tale to

<p>They that were sent to inquire, were instantlie desired of the men of warre k&eacute;eping
the coast (which thereof were before instructed &amp; admonished) to descend and
take land, affirming that they were appointed by the duke of Buckingham there to
await and tarie for the arriuall and landing of the earle of Richmond, and to conduct
him safelie into the campe, where the duke not far of laie incamped with a mightie
armie, and an host of great strength and power, to the intent that the duke and the
earle, ioining in puissances and forces togither, might prosecute and chase king
Richard being destitute of men, and in maner desperate, and so by that meanes,
and their owne labours, to obteine the end of their enterprise which they had before
begun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle arriueth in Normandie &amp; passeth by land into Britaine againe.</div>

<p>The earle of Richmond suspecting their flattering request to be but a fraud (as it
was in d&eacute;ed) after he perceiued none of his ships to appeare in sight, he weied vp his anchors,
halsed vp his sailes, &amp; hauing a prosperous and streinable wind, and a fresh gale sent
euen by God to deliuer him from that perill and ieopardie, arriued safe and in all securitie
in the duchie of Normandie, where he (to refresh and solace his soldiers and people)
tooke his recreation by the space of thr&eacute;e daies, and cl&eacute;erelie determined with part
of his companie to passe all by land againe into Britaine. And in the meane season he
sent ambassadors to the French king, called Charles the eight, which newlie succ&eacute;eded
his father king Lewes the eleuenth, not long before departed to God, requiring of
him a safe conduct and licence to passe thorough his countrie of Normandie into Britaine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles the 8. of France his beneuolence to the earle of Richmond.</div>

<p>This yoong king, hauing compassion of the misfortune of the earle of Richmond,
not onelie gentlie granted and assigned to him a pasport; but also liberallie disbursed
to him a great summe of monie for his conduct and expenses necessarie in his long
iournie and passage. But the earle trusting in the French kings humanitie, aduentured
to send his ships home into Britaine, and to set forward himselfe by land on his iournie,
making no great hast till his messengers were returned. Which being with that benefit so
comforted, and with hope of prosperous successe so incouraged, marched towards
Britaine with all diligence, intending there to consult further with his louers &amp; fr&eacute;ends
of his affaires and enterprises. When he was returned againe into Britaine, he was
certified by credible information, that the duke of Buckingham had lost his head; and
that the marquesse Dorset, and a great number of noble men of England, had a little
before inquired and searched for him there, and were now returned to Vannes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle lamenteth and reioiseth.</div>

<p>When he had heard these newes thus reported, he first sorowed and lamented his
first attempt and setting forward of his fr&eacute;ends, and in especiall of the nobilitie, not
to haue more fortunatelie succ&eacute;eded. Secondarilie, he reioised on the other part, that
God had sent him so manie valiant and prudent capteins to be his companions in his
martiall enterprises, trusting suerlie and nothing doubting in his owne opinion, but
that all his businesse should be wiselie compassed, and brought to a good conclusion.
Wherefore he determining with all diligence to set forward his new begun businesse,
departed to Rheims, and sent certeine of his priuie seruitours to conduct and bring
the marquesse and other noble men to his presence. When they knew that he was
safelie returned into Britaine, Lord how they reioised! for before that time they missed
him, and knew not in what part of the world to make inquirie or search for him. For
they doubted and no lesse feared least he had taken land in England, &amp; fallen into the
hands of king Richard, in whose person they knew well was neither mercie nor compassion.</p>

Which m&eacute;eting after great ioy and solace, and no small thanks giuen and rendered on
both parts, they aduisedlie debated and communed of their great businesse and weightie
enterprise. In the which season the feast of the Natiuitie of our sauiour Christ happened,
on which daie all the English lords went with their solemnitie to the ch&eacute;efe

first tooke a corporall oth on his honor, promising that incontinent after he shuld be
possessed of the crowne and dignitie of the realme of England, he would be conioined
in matrimonie with the ladie Elizabeth daughter to king Edward the fourth. Then
all the companie sware to him fealtie, and did to him homage (as though he had b&eacute;ene
that time the crowned king, and annointed prince) promising faithfullie, and firmelie
affirming, that they would not onelie loose their worldlie substance; but also be depriued
of their liues and worldlie felicitie, rather than to suffer king Richard that tyrant
longer to rule and reigne ouer them.</p>

<p>Which solemne oths made and taken, the earle of Richmond declared and communicated
all these dooings to Francis duke of Britaine, desiring &amp; most heartilie
requiring him to aid him with a greater armie to conduct him into his countrie, which
so sore longed and looked for his returne, and to the which he was by the more part
of the nobilitie and communaltie called and desired. Which (with Gods aid, and the
dukes comfort) he doubted not in short time to obteine; requiring him further to prest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
to him a conuenient summe of monie; affirming that all such summes of monie which
he had receiued of his especiall fr&eacute;ends, were spent and consumed in preparation of
his last iourneie made toward England; which summes of monie, after his enterprise
once atchiued, he in the word of a prince faithfullie promised to repaie and restore
againe. The duke promised him aid and helpe. Vpon confidence whereof he rigged
his ships, and set foorth a nauie well decked with ordinance, and warlikelie furnished
with all things necessarie, to the intent to saile forward shortlie, and to loose no

he should not long liue after: which fell out in the end to be true, not in respect of
this castle, but in respect of Henrie earle of Richmond, who the next yeare following

as the enterprise of a woman was of him reputed of no regard or estimation; and
that the lord Thomas hir husband had purged himselfe sufficientlie to be innocent of

<p>Here is to be noted, that beside the rime which is reported by some to be the onelie
cause for which this gentleman suffered, I find in a register booke of indictements
concerning fellonies and treasons by sundrie persons committed, that the said Collingborne
(by the name of William Collingborne) late of Lidyard in the countie of Wilshire

offering to him for his paines eight pounds, to go ouer into Britaine vnto Henrie erle
of Richmond, Thomas marquesse Dorset, Iohn Cheineie esquier, and others, which
in the last parlement holden at Westminster had b&eacute;ene atteinted of sundrie high

if the said earle of Richmond and his partakers, following the counsell of the said

Iulie, in the said second yeare, within the parish of saint Gregories in Faringdon

same being published, might stir the people to a commotion against the king. And
those bils and writings in rime so deuised and written, the same Collingborne the
daie and yeare last mentioned, had fastened and set vpon diuerse doores of the cathedrall

<div class="sidenote">S&eacute;e Scotland pag. 284, 285.</div>

<p>King Richard being thus disquieted in mind, and doubtfull for the suertie of his owne
estate, called to remembrance that confederations, honest bands and pacts of amitie,
concluded and had betwixt princes and gouernours, are the efficient cause that realmes
and common wealths are strengthened with double power, that is, with aid of fr&eacute;ends
abroad, and their owne forces at home. Wherevpon he deuised how to conclude a
league and amitie with his neighbour the king of Scots: who not long before had
made diuerse incursions and roads into the realme of England. And although he had
not much gotten; yet verelie he lost not much. And now euen as king Richard could
haue wished, he of himselfe made sute for peace or truce to be had betwixt him and
king Richard; who willinglie giuing eare to that sute, commissioners were appointed
to m&eacute;ete about the treatie thereof, as in the historie of Scotland it maie appeare.</p>

<p>At length they agr&eacute;ed vpon a truce for thr&eacute;e y&eacute;eres, and withall for a further increase
of firme fr&eacute;endship and sure amitie (betwixt him and the king of Scots) king
Richard entered into a treatie also of aliance for the concluding of a marriage betwixt
the duke of Rothsaie (eldest sonne to the king of Scots) and the ladie Anne de la
Poole daughter to Iohn duke of Suffolke and the duchesse Anne, sister to king
Richard: which sister he so much fauoured, that studieng by all waies and meanes
possible, how to aduance hir linage, he did not onelie thus s&eacute;eke to preferre hir daughter
in marriage; but also after the death of his sonne, he proclaimed Iohn earle of Lincolne
hir sonne and his nephue, heire apparant to the crowne of England, disheriting
king Edwards daughters, whose brethren (as ye haue heard) he most wickedlie had
caused to be murthered and made awaie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A marriage concluded betwixt the prince of Rothsaie &amp; the duke of Suffolkes daughter.</div>

<p>The king of Scots standing in n&eacute;ed of fr&eacute;ends, although not so greatlie as king

Richard, insomuch that it tooke effect, and by commissioners was passed and concluded,
in maner as in the historie of Scotland it likewise appeareth. But albeit that
by this league and amitie thus couenanted and concluded, it might be thought, that
all conspiracies, coniurations, and confederacies against king Richard had b&eacute;ene extinct,
especiallie considering the duke of Buckingham and his alies were dispatched
out of the waie, some by death, and some by flight and banishment into farre countries:
yet king Richard, more doubting than trusting to his owne people and fr&eacute;ends,
was continuallie vexed and troubled in mind for feare of the earle of Richmonds returne:
which dailie dread and hourelie agonie caused him to liue in dolefull miserie,

<div class="sidenote">King Richard attempteth the duke of Britaine to deliuer the earle of Richmond into his hands.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A great temptation with large offers.</div>

<p>Wherefore he intending to be rel&eacute;eued, and to haue an end of all his doubtfull dangers,
determined cl&eacute;erelie to extirpate and plucke vp by the roots all the matter and
ground of his feare and doubts. Insomuch that (after long and deliberate consultation
had) nothing was for his purpose and intent thought either more necessarie or
expedient than once againe with price, praier, and rewards, to attempt the duke of
Britaine, in whose territorie the earle of Richmond then abode, to deliuer the said
earle into his hands: by which onelie meanes he should be discharged of all feare and
perill, and brought to rest and quietnesse both of bodie and mind. Wherefore incontinent
he sent certeine ambassadors to the duke of Britaine, which tooke vpon them
(beside the great and ample rewards that they brought with them into Britaine) that
king Richard should yearelie paie and answer the duke of all the reuenues, rents, and
profits of the seigniories, lands, and possessions, as well belonging and apperteining
to the erle of Richmond, as to anie other noble or gentleman, which then were in the
earles companie; if he after that time would k&eacute;epe them in continuall prison, and
restraine them from libertie.</p>

<p>The ambassadors (furnished with these and other instructions) arriued in Britaine,
and came to the dukes house; where with him they could haue no maner of communication
concerning their weightie affaires: by reason that he being faint and weakened
by a long and dailie infirmitie, began a little to wax idle and weake in his wit and remembrance.
For which cause Peter Landoise his ch&eacute;efe treasuror, a man both of
pregnant wit and great authoritie, ruled and adiudged all things at his pleasure and
commandement, for which cause (as men set in authoritie be not best beloued) he excited
&amp; prouoked against him the malice and euill will of the nobilitie of Britaine,
which afterward (for diuerse great offenses by him during his authoritie perpetrate
&amp; committed) by their meanes was brought to death &amp; confusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peter Landoise is mooued by the ambassadors of king Richard in their sute.</div>

to him declared their maisters commandement, instantlie requiring and humblie desiring
him (in whose power it laie to doo all things in Britaine) that he would
fr&eacute;endlie assent to the request of king Richard: offering to him the same rewards and
lands, that they should haue offered to the duke. This Peter (which was no lesse disdeined
than hated almost of all the people of Britaine) thought that if he did assent
&amp; satisfie king Richards petition and desire, he should be of power and abilitie sufficient
to withstand and repell the malicious attempts and disdeinfull inuentions of his
enuious aduersaries. Wherefore he faithfullie promised to accomplish king Richards
request &amp; desire: so that he kept promise with him, that he might be able to withstand
the cankered malice of his secret enimies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">S&eacute;e page 343.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Fl.</i></div>

<p>This act that he promised to doo, was not for anie grudge or malice that he bare
vnto the erle of Richmond: for (as you haue heard before) he deliuered him from the
perill of death at saint Malos, when he was in great doubt of life, and ieopardie.
But as cause ariseth we euer offend, and that curssed hunger of gold, and execrable
thirst of lucre, and inward feare of losse of authoritie, driueth the blind minds of
couetous men, &amp; ambitious persons to euils and misch&eacute;efs innumerable, not remembring
losse of good name, obloquie of the people, nor in conclusion the punishment
of God for their merits and deserts. [Which vengeance of God for such falshood was
more to be feared, than the gaie offers of the king to be desired; for the one was sure
to fall, the other was likelie to faile. Wherefore it is wisedome to make choise of a
fr&eacute;end, by the rule of the wiseman to be obserued in wine, which is drunke with
pleasure when it is old. Neither dooth it stand with a mans safetie to trust a

<p>The noble men somewhat suspicious of things newlie imagined, without any tarieng,
scowring the waies as fast as their horsses could runne, came out of the duchie of
Britaine into the duchie of Aniou in the dominion of France, where they taried the
erles comming, which two daies after departed out of Vannes, onelie accompanied
with fiue seruitors, as though he had gone secretlie to visit a familiar friend of his, in a
small village adioining. No man suspected then he would depart, considering that a
great multitude of Englishmen were left and continued in the citie. But after that
he had passed directlie fiue miles forward, he suddenlie turned into a solitarie wood
next adioining, where clothing himselfe in the simple coat of his poore seruant, made
and appointed his said minister leader and maister of his small companie, &amp; he as an
humble page diligentlie followed and serued his counterfeit gouernor, neither resting
nor refreshing themselues, except the baiting of their horsses, till they by waies
vnknowne, now this way, now turning that way, came to their companie abiding
them in Angiers.</p>

<p>The fourth day after the earle of Richmond was thus departed, that craftie merchant
Peter Landoise, thirsting still after his preie promised by king Richard, was readie to
set forward his crew of souldiers, which he priuilie had consigned, with certeine
trustie capteins for that onelie purpose appointed and elected, to performe and atchiue
his pretended enterprise; dissembling and feining them to be conducted and hired
by him to serue the earle of Richmond, and him to conduct in his returne towards his
natiue countrie: meaning no other thing but to apprehend him, and the other noble
men in his retinue, which no such fraud suspected, nor yet anie treason imagined,
vnware and vnprouided, and destitute of all aid, and them to cast and commit suddenlie
into continuall captiuitie and bondage, to the intent that by this his wretched
and naughtie act, he might satisfie the charitable request and louing desire of good
king Richard, more for his owne profit than king Richards gaine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peter Landoise his expectation disappointed by the priuate and vnknowne departing of the earle.</div>

<p>But when this craftie dissembler Peter Landoise, which was no wilier than an old
fox, perceiued that the earle was departed (thinking that to be true that he imagined)
Lord how currors ran into euerie coast! how light horssemen gallopped in euerie str&eacute;et!
to follow and deteine him, if by anie possibilitie h&eacute;e could be met with and ouertaken,
and him to apprehend and bring captiue into the citie of Vannes. The horssemen
made such diligence, and with such celeritie set forward their iournie, that nothing
was more likelie than they to haue obteined, yea and seized their preie. For the earle
of Richmond was not entered into the realme of France scarse one houre, but the fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>lowers
came to the limits and confines of Britaine, and durst aduenture no further, but
vainlie (without their desire) sorrowfullie returned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Britains loue to the earle of Richmond, &amp; the care of his safetie.</div>

<p>At which season were left at Vannes about the number of thr&eacute;e hundred Englishmen,
which not being called to counsell, and vnware of this enterprise, but knowing
of the earles sudden departure, were so incontinentlie astonied, that in maner they
were all in despaire, both of him, and their owne suertie and safegard. But fortune
turned hir saile, and otherwise it happened than their feare them incumbered. For the
duke of Britaine, now being somewhat recouered, was sore displeased, and nothing
contented, that the earle of Richmond was in his dominion so vncourteouslie vsed and
intreated, that he should be by fraud and vntruth compelled to leaue and flie out of
his duchie and countrie, contrarie to his honour. Wherefore he tooke verie great displeasure
with Peter Landoise his treasuror, to whome (although he knew not, and was
ignorant that all the drift was driuen and deuised by him) he laid the fault, and imputed
the crime.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edw. Wooduile &amp; Edward Poinings

<p>Herevpon he sent for Edward Wooduile, and Edward Poinings, valiant esquiers of
England, and deliuered vnto to them monie sufficient for their conduct, willing them
to conueie the rest of the Englishmen being in Britaine, to the erle of Richmonds presence.
When the earle was thus furnished, and appointed with his trustie companie,
and was escaped all the dangers, labirinths, and snares that were set for him: no maruell
though he were iocund and glad of the prosperous successe that happened in his
affaires. Wherefore, least he should s&eacute;eme to be blotted with the note of ingratitude,
he sent diuerse of his gentlemen to the duke of Britaine, the which should publish
and declare to him on the behalfe of the earle, that he and his were onelie by his benefit
and fauour conserued and deliuered from the imminent danger that they were like
to be trapped in. Wherefore at that time he rendered vnto him his most hartie thanks in
words, trusting and not doubting, but in time to come liberallie to recompense him
with acts and d&eacute;eds.</p>

of his accesse and repaire to his person. After that, h&eacute;e required of him helpe
and succour, to the intent that by his immortall benefit to him at that time shewed,
h&eacute;e might safelie returne vnto the nobilitie of his realme; of whome he was generallie
called to take vpon him the crown &amp; scepter of the realme, sith they much hated and
abhorred the tyrannie of king Richard. King Charles promised him aid and comfort,
and bade him be of good courage, and make good cheare; for he assured him that he
would gladlie shew to him his beneuolent mind and bountifull liberalitie. Which

<p>While the earle was thus attendant in the French court, Iohn Vere earle of Oxford,
which (as you haue heard before) was by king Edward kept in prison within the castell
of Hammes, so persuaded Iames Blunt capteine of the same fortresse, and sir
Iohn Fortescue porter of the towne of Calis, that he himselfe was not onelie dismissed
and set at libertie; but they also abandoning and leauing their fruitfull offices, did
condescend to go with him into France to the earle of Richmond, and to take his
part. But Iames Blunt, like a wise capteine, bicause he left his wife remaining in the
castell before his departure, did fortifie the same both with new munitions, and fresh
souldiers. [And here bicause the names of Vere and Fortescue are remembred, it

the said persons, with others.]</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Fl. ex I. S. pag. 733.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Oxford leuieth a power and commeth into England.</div>

<p>&para; Know you therefore, that this sir Iohn Vere earle of Oxford (that withdrew himselfe
from Barnet field, and with all sp&eacute;ed fled into Scotland) in the yere 1473, and
the thirt&eacute;enth of Edward the fourth, did (after he had sometime soiourned there)
saile into France, about the borders whereof he was continuallie houering, as hoping
to win some preie (to support his estate) of such passengers as for merchandize cause
or otherwise must k&eacute;epe their course a long the sea. Whose good successe therein did
not deceiue his mind. For in the end (what of one and other) h&eacute;e got such riches and
other furniture, as he was able to support a chosen number of followers. Wherwith
he (being rel&eacute;eued and incouraged to aduenture to set foot in his countrie in despite of
king Edward) did with his companie of 397 persons, and with his saile of ships
land in the west countrie the last of September, where (partlie by force of his, and
partlie through feare of the inhabitants, but mostlie by a subtill shift) he gat and entered
the castell of saint Michaels mount, a place of strength, and such an harborough,
as he determined to k&eacute;epe the same against all assailants. During the time of
his remaine there, he would with his companie manie times descend the hill, and come
abrode in the countrie, where (for his loue, for his honour, and for the hatred they
bare to king Edward) he was well interteined of manie gentlemen and others of the
countrie.</p>

<p>But this matter vnpossible long to be kept in secret, was at length brougnt to the
knowledge of king Edward; who being somewhat mooued, thought in the beginning
to withstand such misch&eacute;efe, least suffering too long, &amp; the earle growing to strength,
he might be put to as great plunge for the crowne as he had bene twise before: wherwith
s&eacute;eing he was possessed, he grew resolute to k&eacute;epe it both by policie and puissance,
maugre the open violence and priuie practises as well of his professed as secret
enimies. For he ran through the pikes yer he could obteine it, and offered his bodie
to manie desperate perils in hope to get it; which if he had either feared or shunned,
it is a matter of demand whether he had euer had it. For pretious things, as principalities
and such like, vnlesse they be hereditarie, as they are hardlie kept, so are they
not easilie gotten: for he that desireth to gather a rose, must not be tender ouer his
fingers bicause of thornes; and he that would tast honie fresh out of the hiue, must
not be scared with the stinging of b&eacute;es, as the poet verie sw&eacute;etlie noteth:</p>

<div class="sidenote">The name of Fortescue wherevpon it grew.</div>

<p>Wherefore king Edward gaue in charge to Bodringham, ruler or shiriffe of Cornewall
to assemble such power as he could; and besieging the mount, he should either
take or kill the earle of Oxford. The which the shiriffe did accordinglie, but that so
feintlie and fauourablie, as he permitted the earle of Oxford (now in distresse) to reuittell
the mount, knowing that there was no waie to expell the earle from thence but
by famine. These things thus doone (the king not pleased, and the earle not displeased)
one Fortescue (which surname is deduced from the strength of his shield,
whereof that familie had first originall) was with a stronger and faithfuller companie
sent by king Edward to laie siege to the castell; which he did, and long continued.
For it was not easie to be had, being (of it selfe) by nature stronglie set, by policie
well vittelled, and by manhood valiantlie defended: which mooued the king to
assay an other means therefore, and to s&eacute;e if policie might doo that which force could
not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deuises to withdraw the earles power from him.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Oxford submitteth himselfe &amp; y&eacute;eldeth the castell into the kings hands.</div>

<p>For which cause, as Fortescue still continued the said siege, the K. supposed it best
(if possiblie he might) to weaken the earles part, by withdrawing the strength and
hearts of his people from him: which might not be doone but with rich promises and
strong pardons. On which consideration he sent liberallie pardons to them, and in
the end so secretlie wrought with the earles men: that if the earle (fearing the woorst,
and iudging it better to trie the kings mercie, than to hazard the extreamitie of
taking, in which rested nothing but assured death) had not wholie submitted himselfe
to king Edward, he had b&eacute;ene by his owne men most dishonestlie betraied, and suddenlie
taken prisoner. Wherevpon the earle comming foorth to Fortescue, did there
y&eacute;eld himselfe and the castell into the kings hands. At what time (being the fift&eacute;enth
of Februarie, which from the first entrance of the earle into that castell being the last
of September, was about foure moneths and fouret&eacute;ene daies) the same Fortescue
entred the mount, &amp; tooke possession thereof, finding it yet sufficientlie vittelled to
haue susteined an other siege more than one halfe yeare. After all things were thus
quieted, the earle, the lord Beaumont, two brothers of the said earle, and Thomas
Clifford, were brought vp as prisoners vnto king Edward. And now to our present
historie againe.</p>

<p>When the earle of Richmond saw the earle of Oxenford, he was rauished with an
incredible gladnesse, that he being a man of so high nobilitie, of such knowledge
and practises in feates of warre, and so constant, trustie and assured (which alwaie
had studied for the maintenance and preferment of the house of Lancaster) was now
by Gods prouision deliuered out of captiuitie and imprisonment; and in time so necessarie
and conuenient come to his aid, succour, and aduancement; in whome more
surer than anie other he might put his trust and confidence, and take lesse paine and
trauell in his owne person. For it was not hid from him, that such as euer had taken
part with king Edward before this time, came to doo him seruice, either for malice
they bare king Richard, or else for feare to liue vnder his cruell rule and tyrannous
gouernance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divers English doo voluntarilie submit themselues to the earle of Richmond in France.</div>

<p>Not long after, the French king returned againe to Paris, whome the earle of Richmond
followed, intending there to solicit his matter to the conclusion. Wherevpon
he besought king Charles to take vpon him the whole tuition and defense of him and
his cause, so that he and his companie being (by his means) aided and comforted,
should confesse and saie, their wealth, victorie, and aduancement to haue flowed and
budded foorth of his bountifulnesse and liberalitie, which they would (God willing)
shortlie acquite. In the meane season, diuerse Englishmen, which either fled out of
England for feare, or were at Paris to learne and studie good literature and vertuous
doctrine, came voluntarilie and submitted themselues to the earle of Richmond, and
vowed &amp; sware to take his part. Amongst whom was Richard Fox a priest, a man of
great wit and no lesse learning, whome the earle incontinent receiued into secret familiaritie,
and in br&eacute;efe time erected and aduanced him to high dignities and promotions,
and in conclusion made him bishop of Winchester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">K. Richards deuise to infringe and defeat the earle of Richmo&#772;ds purpose.</div>

<p>In the meane season, king Richard was crediblie aduertised, what promises and
oths the earle and his confederates had made and sworne togither at Reimes, and how
by the earles means all the Englishmen were passed out of Britaine into France.
Wherefore being sore dismaid, and in a maner desperate, bicause his craftie chieuance
tooke none effect in Britaine, he imagined &amp; deuised how to infringe and disturbe the
earles purpose by an other meane; so that by the marriage of ladie Elizabeth his n&eacute;ece, he
should pretend no claime nor title to the crowne. For he thought if that marriage
failed, the earles ch&eacute;efe combe had b&eacute;ene clearlie cut. And bicause that he being
blinded with the ambitious desire of rule before this time in obteining the kingdome,
had committed and doone manie curssed acts, and detestable tyranies, yet according
to the old prouerbe; Let him take the bull that stale awaie the calfe: he thought all
facts by him committed in times passed to be but of small moment, and not to be regarded
in comparison of that misch&eacute;euous imagination, which he now newlie began
and attempted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A subtill and lewd practise of king Richard to beguile the earle of Richmond.</div>

<p>There came into his vngratious mind a thing not onelie detestable to be spoken of
in the remembrance of man, but much more cruell and abhominable to be put in execution.
For when he reuolued in his wauering mind, how great a founteine of misch&eacute;efe
toward him should spring, if the earle of Richmond should be aduanced to the
marriage of his n&eacute;ece: which thing he heard saie by the rumor of the people, that no
small number of wise and wittie personages enterprised to compasse and bring to conclusion:
he cl&eacute;erelie determined to reconcile to his fauour his brothers wife qu&eacute;ene
Elizabeth, either by faire words, or liberall promises; firmelie bel&eacute;euing hir fauour once
obteined, that she would not sticke to commit (and louinglie credit) to him the rule
and gouernance both of hir and hir daughters, and so by that meanes the earle
of Richmond of the affinitie of his n&eacute;ece should be vtterlie defrauded and beguiled.</p>

<p>And if no ingenious remedie could be otherwise inuented, to saue the innumerable
misch&eacute;efes which were euen at hand, and like to fall if it should happen qu&eacute;ene Anne
his wife to depart out of this present life, then he himselfe would rather take to wife
his cousine and n&eacute;ece the ladie Elizabeth; than for lacke of that affinitie the whole
realme should run to ruine, as who said, that if he once fell from his estate and dignitie,
the ruine of the relme must n&eacute;eds shortlie insue and follow. Wherefore he sent
to the qu&eacute;ene (being in sanctuarie) diuerse and often messengers, which first should
excuse and purge him of all things before against hir attempted or procured, and after
should so largelie promise promotions innumerable, and benefits, not onelie to hir,
but also to hir sonne lord Thomas marquesse Dorset, that they should bring hir (if
it were possible) into some wanhope, or (as men saie) into a fooles paradise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The inconstancie of Q. Elizabeth.</div>

<p>The messengers, being men both of wit and grauitie, so persuaded the qu&eacute;ene with
great and pregnant reasons, &amp; what with faire and large promises, that she began
somewhat to relent, and to giue to them no deafe eare; insomuch that she faithfullie
promised to submit and y&eacute;eld hir selfe fullie and frankelie to the kings will and pleasure.
And so she putting in obliuion the murther of hir innocent children, the infamie
and dishonour spoken by the king hir husband, the liuing in adulterie laid to hir
charge, the bastarding of hir daughters; forgetting also the faithfull promise and
open oth made to the countesse of Richmond, mother to the earle Henrie, blinded
by auaricious affection, &amp; seduced by flattering words, first deliuered into king Richards
hands hir fiue daughters, as lambs once againe committed to the custodie of the
rauenous woolfe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Qu&eacute;ene Elizabeth allureth hir sonne the marquesse Dorset home out of France.</div>

<p>After she sent letters to the marquesse hir sonne, being then at Paris with the earle
of Richmond, willing him in anie wise to leaue the earle, and without delaie to repaire
into England, where for him were prouided great honours, and honourable promotions;
ascerteining him further, that all offenses on both parts were forgotten and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
forgiuen, and both he and she highlie incorporated in the kings heart. Suerlie the inconstancie
of this woman were much to be maruelled at, if all women had b&eacute;ene
found constant; but let men speake, yet women of the verie bond of nature will follow
their owne sex. But it was no small allurement that king Richard vsed to ouercome
hir (for we know by experience that women are of a proud disposition, and that
the waie to win them is by promises of preferment) and therefore it is the lesse maruell
that he by his wilie wit had made conquest of hir wauering will. [Besides that, it is
to be presumed that she stood in feare to impugne his demands by denials, least he in
his malicious mood might take occasion to deale roughlie with hir, being a weake woman,
and of a timorous spirit.]</p>

<p>Now when king Richard had thus with glorious promises, and flattering words,
pleased and appeased the mutable mind of qu&eacute;ene Elizabeth, which knew nothing
lesse than that he most intended; he caused all his brothers daughters to be conueied
into his palace with solemne receiuing: as though with his new familiar and louing
interteinment they should forget, and in their minds blot out the old committed iniurie,
and late executed tyrannie. Now nothing was contrarie and against his diuelish purpose,
but that his mansion was not void of his wife, which thing he in any wise adiudged
necessarie to be doone. But there was one thing that so much feared and
staied him from committing this abhominable murther, bicause (as you haue heard
before) he began to counterfet the image of a good and well disposed person: and
therefore he was afeard least the sudden death of his wife once openlie knowne, he
should loose the good and credible opinion which the people had of him, without
anie desert, conceiued and reported.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A forged co&#772;plaint of king Richard against his wife to be rid of hir.</div>

<p>But in conclusion, euill counsell preuailed in a wit latelie minded to misch&eacute;efe,
and turned from all goodnesse. So that his vngratious desire ouercame his honest
feare. And first to enter into the gates of his imagined enterprise, he absteined both
from the bed and companie of his wife. Then he complained to diuerse noble men
of the realme, of the infortunate sterilitie and barennesse of his wife, bicause she
brought foorth no fruit and generation of hir bodie. And in especiall he recounted
to Thomas Rotheram archbishop of Yorke (whome latelie he had deliuered out of ward
and captiuitie) these impediments of his qu&eacute;ene, and diuerse other, thinking that
he would reueale to hir all these things, trusting the sequele hereof to take due
effect, that she hearing this grudge of hir husband, &amp; taking therefore an inward
thought, would not long liue in this world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A rumor spred abroad of the qu&eacute;enes death at the procurement of king Richard.</div>

<p>Of this the bishop gathered (which well knew the complexion and vsage of the
king) that the qu&eacute;enes daies were short, and that he declared to certeine of his
secret fr&eacute;ends. After this he procured a common rumor (but he would not haue the
author knowne) to be published and spred abroad among the common people, that
the qu&eacute;ene was dead; to the intent that she taking some conceit of this strange
fame, should fall into some sudden sicknesse or gr&eacute;euous maladie: and to prooue if
afterwards she should fortune by that or anie other waies to lease her life, whether
the people would impute hir death to the thought or sicknesse, or thereof would laie
the blame to him. Now when the qu&eacute;ene heard tell that so horrible a rumor of hir
death was sprung amongst the communaltie, she sore suspected and iudged the
world to be almost at an end with hir. And in that sorowfull agonie she with
lamentable countenance and sorowfull cheare, repaired to the presence of the king
hir husband, demanding of him what it should meane, that he had iudged hir worthie
to die.</p>

<div class="sidenote">K. Richard casteth his loue on his n&eacute;ece purposing to marie her.</div>

<p>The king answered hir with faire words, and with smiling and flattering leasings
comforted hir; and bid hir be of good ch&eacute;ere, for (to his knowledge) she should
haue no other cause. But howsoeuer that it fortuned, either by inward thought and
pensiuenesse of hart, or by infection of poison (which is affirmed to be most likelie)
within few daies after the qu&eacute;ene departed out of this transitorie life, and was with
due solemnitie buried in the church of S. Peter at Westminster. This is the same
Anne, one of the daughters of the earle of Warwike, which (as you haue heard before)
at the request of Lewes the French king was maried to prince Edward, sonne
to king Henrie the sixt. The king thus (according to his long desire) losed out of
the bonds of matrimonie, began to cast a foolish fantasie to ladie Elizabeth his n&eacute;ece,
making much sute to haue hir ioined with him in lawfull matrimonie.</p>

<p>But bicause all men and the maiden hirselfe most of all detested and abhorred this
vnlawfull, and in maner vnnaturall copulation; he determined to prolong and defer
the matter, till he were in a more quietnesse. For all that verie season he was
oppressed with great, weightie, and vrgent causes, and businesses on euerie side;
considering that dailie, part of the nobilitie sailed into France to the earle of Richmond:
other priuilie fauoured and aided certeine of the coniuration, so that of his
short end few or none were in doubt. And the common people (for the most part)
were brought to such desperation, that manie of them had rather be reputed and
taken of him in the number of his enimies, than to abide the chance and hazard to
haue their goods taken as a spoile of victorie, by his enimies. [In such hatred they
had the wretch, wishing his hart in their hands with the hazard of their heads. For
how can people saie well or thinke well of tyrants, whose propertie it is to teare

<div class="sidenote">What noble men K. Richard most mistrusted.</div>

<p>Amongst the noble men whome he most mistrusted, these were the principall.
Thomas lord Stanleie, sir William Stanleie his brother, Gilbert Talbot, and six hundred
other: of whose purposes although king Richard were not ignorant, yet he gaue
neither confidence nor credence to anie one of them; and least of all to the lord
Stanleie, bicause he was ioined in matrimonie with the ladie Margaret, mother to the
earle of Richmond, as afterward apparantlie y&eacute;e may perceiue. For when the said
lord Stanleie would haue departed into his countrie to visit his familie, and to recreate
and refresh his spirits (as he openlie said, but the truth was, to the intent to be in a
perfect readinesse to receiue the earle of Richmond at his first arriuall in England)
the king in no wise would suffer him to depart, before he had left as an hostage in
the court George Stanleie lord Strange, his first begotten sonne and heire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The castell of Hammes deliuered vnto the earle of Richmond.</div>

<p>While king Richard was thus troubled and vexed with imaginations of the troublous
time that was like to come: lo, euen suddenlie he heard newes, that fire was sprung out
of the smoke, and the war freshlie begun; and that the castell of Hammes was deliuered
into the hands of the earle of Richmond, by the meanes of the earle of
Oxford; and that not onlie he, but also Iames Blunt capteine of the castell, were
fled into France to aid the earle Henrie. Wherefore he, thinking it great policie to
withstand the first brunt, sent the most part of the garrison of Calis, to recouer
againe by force the castell of Hammes. They which were in the castell, perceiuing
their aduersaries to approch, prepared munitions and engines for their defense, and
sent also to the earle of Richmond, to aduertise him of their sudden inuasion, requiring
of him hastie aid and sp&eacute;edie succour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Thomas Brandon entereth the castell.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Why king Richard gaue licence to all in the castell to depart in safetie with bag and baggage.</div>

<p>The earle sl&eacute;eping not this first begun assault, sent the earle of Oxford with an
elected companie of souldiers to raise the siege, and rescue the castell: which at their
first arriuing pitched their campe not far from their enimies. Now while king
Richards men gaue vigilant eie, waiting least the earle of Oxford should take anie aduantage
of them that laie on that side of the castell; Thomas Brandon with thirtie
approoued men of war by a marish, which laie on the other side, entered into the castell.
The souldiers within greatlie incouraged, &amp; much comforted by this new succour
and aid, grieued the enimies, by shooting from the walles more than they were accustomed
to doo. Then they of the castell vexed their enimies on the fore part: and
the earle of Oxford no lesse molested &amp; vnquieted them on the other part. Which was
the occasion that king Richards men offered (of their owne m&eacute;ere motion) licence to all
being within the castell to depart in safetie, with bag and baggage, nothing excepted.</p>

<p>Which condition the earle of Oxford, comming onelie for that purpose to deliuer
his louing fr&eacute;ends out of all perill and danger and chieflie of all, his old hostesse Iane
Blunt, wife to Iames Blunt the capteine, would in no wise forsake or refuse: and so
leauing the castell bare and vngarnished both of vittels and artillerie, came safelie to
the earle of Richmond soiourning in Paris. During this time, king Richard was crediblie
informed of his inquisitors and espials, that the earle of Richmond was with
long sute in the court of France sore wearied; and desiring great aid, could obteine
small reliefe: in somuch that all things went so farre backwards, that such things as
were with great diligence (and no lesse deliberation) purposed and determined to be
set forward, were now dashed and ouerthrowne to the ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">K. Richard calleth home his ships of warre from the narrow seas.</div>

<p>King Richard either being too light of credence, or seduced and deluded by his
craftie taletellers, greatlie reioised, as though he had obteined the ouer hand of his enimies
with triumphant victorie, and thought himselfe neuer so suerlie deliuered of all feare and
dreadfull imaginations: so that he n&eacute;eded now no more once for that cause either to
wake, or to breake his golden sl&eacute;epe. Wherefore he called home againe his ships of
warre, which he had appointed to k&eacute;epe the narrow seas, and dispatched all such souldiers
as he had deputed to k&eacute;epe certeine garrisons, and to stop certeine passages (as
you haue heard before.) Yet least he might for lacke of prouision be suddenlie trapped,
he streightlie charged and gaue in commandement to all noblemen, and especiallie
such as inhabited n&eacute;ere the sea coast, and on the frontiers of Wales, that (according
to the vsage of the countrie) they should k&eacute;epe diligent watch and strong ward, to the
intent that his aduersaries in no wise should haue anie place opportune easilie to take
land, without defense or rebutting back.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The vse of beacons in countries n&eacute;ere the sea coasts.</div>

<p>For the custome of the countries adjoining n&eacute;ere to the sea is (especiallie in
the time of warre) on euerie hill or high place to erect a beacon with a great lanterne in
the top, which may be s&eacute;ene and discerned a great space off. And when the noise is
once bruted that the enimies approch n&eacute;ere the land, they suddenlie put fire in the
lanternes, and make shouts and outcries from towne to towne, and from village to
village. Some run in post from place to place, admonishing the people to be readie
to resist the ieopardie, and defend the perill. And by this policie the fame is soone
blowne to euerie citie and towne, in somuch that aswell the citizens as the rurall people
be in short space assembled and armed to repell and put backe the new arriued
enimies. [Whereas if the necessarie vse of this visible warning were neglected, the
policie of the enimie might priuilie so preuaile, as that the people should sooner fall
into perill irrecouerable, than they could thinke on (much lesse prouide) meanes to
auoid it.]</p>

<p>But now to returne to our purpose. King Richard thus somewhat eased of his
accustomed pensiuenesse, began to be a little more merrie, &amp; tooke lesse thought and
care for outward enimies than he was woont to doo; as who say, that he with politike
prouision should withstand the destinie which hoong ouer his head, and was ordeined
in briefe time suddenlie to fall. Such is the force and puissance of diuine iustice, that
euerie man shall lesse regard, lesse prouide, lesse be in doubt of all things, when he is
most n&eacute;erest punishment, and next to his mischance for his offenses &amp; crimes. [For
though God did forbeare him a while, yet was that forbearance no acquittance, but
rather a time of preparing &amp; making vp that which wanted of the plagues that God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">Dissention among the p&eacute;eres of France made the earle
of Richmond renew his sute and put him to his shifts.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The marques Dorset forsaketh the earle.</div>

<p>About this season, while the earle of Richmond was desiring aid of the French
king, certeine noble men were appointed to rule the realme of France, during the minoritie
of king Charles, which amongst themselues were not of one opinion. Of which
dissention, Lewes duke of Orleance was the chiefe stirrer, who bicause he had maried
ladie Ioane sister to the French king, tooke vpon him aboue other the rule and
administration of the whole realme. By reason of which controuersie, no one man
was suffered to rule all. Wherefore the earle of Richmond was compelled to make
sute to euerie one of the councell seuerallie one after another, requiring and desiring
them of aid and reliefe in his weightie businesse, and so his cause was prolonged and
deferred. During which time, Thomas marquesse Dorset, which was (as you haue
heard) intised by his mother to returne againe into England, partlie despairing in the
good successe of the earle of Richmond, and partlie ouercome and vanquished with
the faire glosing promises of king Richard: secretlie in the night season stale
out of Paris, and with all diligent expedition tooke his iournie toward Flanders.</p>

<p>When relation of his departure was made to the earle of Richmond, and the other
noble men, no maruell though they were astonied and greatlie amazed. Yet that notwithstanding,
they required of the French king, that it might be lawfull for them in
his name, and by his commandement, to take and staie their companion, confederate,
and partaker of all their counsell, in what place within his realme and territorie so
euer they could find him. Which petition once obteined, they sent out currors into
euerie part, amongst whom Humfreie Cheinie (plaieng the part of a good bloud hound)
followed the tract of the flier so euen by the sent, that he ouertooke and apprehended
him not far from Campeigne; and so what with reason, and what with faire promises,
being persuaded, he returned againe to his companions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Richmond hath men and monie of the French king for hostages.</div>

<p>The earle of Richmond vnburdened of this misaduenture, least by lingering of
daies, and prolonging of time, he might loose the great opportunitie of things to
him offered and ministred: also least he should further wound and molest the minds
of his faithfull and assured fr&eacute;ends, which dailie did expect and tarie for his comming,
determined no longer to protract and deferre the time: but with all diligence and celeritie
attempted his begun enterprise. And so obteining of king Charles a small crew
of men, and borrowing certeine summes of monie of him, and of diuerse other his
priuate fr&eacute;ends, for the which he left as debter (or more likelie as a pledge or hostage)
lord Thomas marquesse Dorset (whome he halfe mistrusted) and sir Iohn Bourchier,
he departed from the French court, and came to the citie of Rone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle is gr&eacute;eued at the newes of king Richards intended marriage with his n&eacute;ece.</div>

<p>While he taried there, making prouision at Harfl&eacute;et in the mouth of the riuer of

Richard (being without children, and now a widower) intended shortlie to marie the
ladie Elizabeth his brothers daughter; and to prefer the ladie Cicilie hir sister to a
man found in a cloud, and of an vnknowne linage and familie. He tooke theses newes
as a matter of no small moment: and so (all things considered) it was of no lesse importance
than he tooke it for. For this thing onelie tooke awaie from him and all his
companions their hope and courage, that they had to obteine an happie enterprise.
And therefore no maruell though it nipped him at the verie stomach: when he thought,
that by no possibilitie he might atteine the mariage of any of K. Edwards daughters,
which was the strongest foundation of his building; by reason whereof he iudged
that all his fr&eacute;ends in England would abandon and shrinke from him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Walter Herbert.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A mariage purposed but disappointed.</div>

<p>Wherefore, making not manie of his counsell, after diuerse consultations, he
determined not yet to set forward: but to tarie and attempt how to get more aid, more
fr&eacute;ends, and more stronger succours. And amongst all other, it was thought most
expedicnt to allure by affinitie in his aid, as a companion in armes, sir Walter Herbert,
a man of an ancient stocke, &amp; of great power among the Welsh, who had with him a
faire ladie to his sister, of age ripe to be coupled with him in matrimonie. And for
the atchiuing of this purpose, messengers were secretlie sent to Henrie earle of Northumberland
(which had before maried another sister of sir Walter Herberts) to the intent
that he should set forward all this deuise and purpose: but the waies were so
narowlie watched, and so manie spies laid, that the messenger proc&eacute;eded not in his
iournie and businesse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Welshmen offer to aid the earle of Richmond.</div>

<p>But in the meane season, there came to the earle a more ioifull message from Morgan
Kidwellie, learned in the temporall law, which declared that Rice ap Thomas, a
man of no lesse valiantnesse than actiuitie, and Iohn Sauage an approoued capteine,
would with all their power be partaker of his quarell. And that Reginald Breie had
collected and gotten togither no small summe of monie for the paiment of the wages
to the souldiers and men of warre: admonishing him also to make quicke expedition,
and to take his course directlie into Wales. The earle of Richmond, bicause he would
no longer linger and wearie his fr&eacute;ends, liuing continuallie betw&eacute;ene hope and feare,
determined in all conuenient hast to set forward, and caried to his ships armor, weapons,
vittels, and all other ordinances expedient for warre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle arriueth at Milford hauen.</div>

<p>After that all things were in readinesse, the earle being accompanied onelie with two
thousand men, and a small number of ships, weied vp his anchors, and halsed vp his
sailes in the moneth of August, and sailed from Harfl&eacute;et with so prosperous a wind,
that the seuenth daie after his departure, he arriued in Wales in the euening, at a place
called Milford hauen, and incontinent tooke land, and came to a place called Dalle; where
he heard saie that a certeine companie of his aduersaries were laid in garrison to defend
his arriuall all the last winter. And the earle at the sunne rising remooued to Hereford
west, being distant from Dalle not full ten miles, where he was ioifullie receiued of the
people, and he arriued there so suddenlie, that he was come and entered the towne at
the same time when the citizens had but knowledge of his comming.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A false rumor of ill newes.</div>

<p>Here he heard newes, which were as vntrue as they trulie were reported to him in
Normandie; that Rice ap Thomas, and Iohn Sauage, with bodie and goods, were
determined to aid king Richard. While he and his companie were some what astonied
at these new tidings, there came such message from the inhabitants of the towne of
Penbroke, that refreshed and reuiued their frosen hearts and daunted courages. For
Arnold Butler a valiant capteine, which first asked pardon for his offenses before time
committed against the earle of Richmond, and that obteined, declared to him that the
Penbrochians were readie to serue and giue their attendance on their naturall and immediat
lord Iasper earle of Penbroke. The earle of Richmond, hauing his armie thus
increased, departed from Hereford west to the towne of Cardigan, being fiue miles
distant from thence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Richmond's power made stronger by accesse of confederats.</div>

<p>While the souldiers were refreshing and trimming themselues in their campe, strange

which laie with a great crue of men at Carmarden, was now with a great armie readie
to approch and bid them battell. With which newes the armie was sore troubled, and
euery man assaied his armour and prooued his weapon, and were prest to defend their
enimies. And as they were in this fearfull doubt, certeine horssemen, which the
earle had sent to make inquirie and search, returned and reported all the countrie to be
quiet, and no let nor impediment to be laid or cast in their iournie. And euen at the
same time, the whole armie was greatlie recomforted, by reason that the comming of
Richard Griffith, a man of great nobilitie, the which notwithstanding that he was
confederate with sir Walter Herbert, and Richard ap Thomas; yet at that verie instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
he came to the earle of Richmond with all his companie; which were of no great

<div class="sidenote">The erle sendeth secret word to his mother and other his fr&eacute;ends that he meant

<p>Then the earle aduanced forward in good hast, making no repose or abode in anie

assaulted euerie place where his enimies had set anie men of warre; which with small
force, and lesse difficultie, he brieflie did ouercome &amp; vanquish. And suddenlie he
was by his espials ascerteined, that sir Walter Herbert, and Rice ap Thomas were in harnesse
before him, readie to incounter with his armie, and to stop their passage. Wherefore
like a valiant capteine he first determined to set on them, and either to destroie
or to take them into his fauour, and after with all his power and puissance to giue
battell to his mortall enimie king Richard. But to the intent his fr&eacute;ends should
know in what readinesse he was, and how he proc&eacute;eded forward; he sent of his most
secret and faithfull seruants with letters and instructions to the ladie Margaret his
mother, to the lord Stanleie and his brother, to sir Gilbert Talbot, and to other his
trustie fr&eacute;ends; declaring to them that he being succoured and holpen with the aid
and reliefe of his fr&eacute;ends, intended to passe ouer the riuer of Seuerne at Shrewesburie,
and so to passe directlie to the citie of London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rice ap Thomas sweareth fealtie and seruice to the earle of Richmond.</div>

<p>Wherefore he required them, as his speciall trust and confidence was fixed in the

to the intent that he and they, at time and place conuenient, might communicate
togither the d&eacute;epenesse of all his doubtfull and weightie businesse. When the messengers
wer dispatched with these commandements and admonitions, he marched
forward toward Shrewesburie: and in his passing, there met and saluted him Rice ap
Thomas with a goodlie band of Welshmen, which making an oth and promise to the earle,
submitted himselfe wholie to his order and commandement. For the earle of Richmond
two daies before made to him promise, that if he would sweare to take his part
and be obedient to him, he would make him chiefe gouernour of Wales: which part
as he faithfullie promised and granted, so (after that he had obteined and possessed
the realme and diademe) he liberallie performed and accomplished the same.</p>

<p>In the meane time the messengers, that were sent, diligentlie executed their charge,
and laden with rewards of them to whom they were sent, returned to him the same
day that he entered into Shrewesburie: and made relation to him that his fr&eacute;ends were
readie in all points to doo all things for him, which either they ought or might doo. The
earle Henrie brought in good hope with this pleasant message, continued foorth his
intended iournie, and came to a little towne called Newport, and pitching his campe
on a little hill adioining, reposed himselfe there that night. In the euening the same
daie came to him sir Gilbert Talbot, with the whole power of the yoong earle of
Shrewesburie then being in ward, which were accounted to the number of two thousand
men. And thus his power increasing, he arriued at the towne of Stafford, and
there paused.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Stanleies deuise to auoid suspicion of K. Richard and to saue his sonnes life.</div>

<p>There also came sir William Stanleie accompanied with a few persons. And after
that the earle and he had communed no long time togither; he reuerted to his souldiors
whom he had assembled togither to serue the earle: which from thence departed to
Lichfield, and lay without the walles in his campe all the night. The next morning
he entered into the towne, and was with all honor like a prince receiued. A daie or
two before, the lord Stanleie, hauing in his band almost fiue thousand men, lodged in
the same towne. But hearing that the erle of Richmond was marching thitherward,
gaue to him place, dislodging him and his, and repaired to a towne called Aderstone,
there abiding the comming of the earle. And this wilie fox did this act, to auoid all
suspicion on king Richards part.</p>

<p>For the lord Stanleie was afraid, least if he should s&eacute;eme openlie to be a fautor or
aider to the earle his sonne in law, before the day of the battell, that king Richard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
which yet vtterlie did not put in him diffidence and mistrust, would put to some
cruell death his sonne and heire apparant George lord Strange, whome king Richard
(as you haue heard before) kept with him as a pledge or hostage, to the intent that
the lord Stanleie his father should attempt nothing preiudiciall to him. King Richard
at this season k&eacute;eping his house in the castle of Notingham, was informed that the
earle of Richmond, with such banished men as were fled out of England to him, were
now arriued in Wales, and that all things necessarie to his enterprise were vnprouided
vnpurueied, and verie weake, nothing m&eacute;et to withstand the power of such as the
king had appointed to m&eacute;et him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">K. Richard contemneth the earle and his power.</div>

<p>This rumor so inflated his mind, that in maner disdeining to heare speake of so small
a companie, he determined at the first to take little or no regard to this so small a
sparkle, declaring the earle to be innocent and vnwise, bicause that he rashly attempted
such a great enterprise with so small and thin a number of warlike persons: and
therefore he gaue a definitiue sentence, that when he came to that point that he should
be compelled to fight against his will, h&eacute;e either should be apprehended aliue, or else
by all likelihood he should of necessitie come to a shamefull confusion: and that he
trusted to be shortlie doone by sir Walter Herbert, and Rice ap Thomas, which then
ruled Wales with equall power and like authoritie.</p>

<p>But yet reuoluing and casting in his mind, that a small war begun and winked at,
and not regarded, maie turne to a great broile and trouble; and that it was prudent
policie not to contemne and disdeine the little power and small weakenesse of the

in maner by vnknowne paths, and vncerteine waies searching, at the last came at
earle Henrie. Diuerse other noble personages, which inwardlie hated king Richard
woorse than a tode or a serpent, did likewise resort to him with all their power and
strength, wishing and working his destruction, who otherwise would haue b&eacute;ene the
instrument of their casting away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A strange chance that happened to the earle of Richmond.</div>

<p>There happened in this progression to the earle of Richmond a strange chance
worthie to be noted. For albeit he was a man of valiant courage, &amp; that his armie
increased, and dailie more and more he waxed mightier and stronger; yet he was not
a litle afeard, bicause he could in no wise be assured of his father in law Thomas
lord Stanleie, which for feare of the destruction of the lord Strange his sonne (as you
haue heard) as yet inclined to neither partie. For if he had gone to the earle, and
that notified to king Richard, his sonne had b&eacute;ene shortlie executed. Wherefore he
accompanied with twentie light horssemen lingered in his iournie, as a man musing &amp;
imagining what was best to be doone. And the more to aggrauate his pensiuenesse,
it was shewed him, that king Richard was at hand with a strong power &amp; a great
armie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Richmond put to a hard shift.</div>

<p>While he thus heauilie dragged behind his host, the whole armie came before the
towne of Tamwoorth; and when he for the d&eacute;epe darknesse could not perceiue the
steps of them that passed on before, and had wandered hither &amp; thither, s&eacute;eking after
his companie and yet not once hearing anie noise or whispering of them; he turned
to a verie little village, being about thr&eacute;e miles from his armie taking great thought,
and much fearing least he should be espied, and so trapped by king Richards scoutwatch.
There he taried all night, not once aduenturing to aske or demand a question
of any creature, he being no more amazed with the ieopardie &amp; perill that was passed,
than with this present chance, sore feared that it shuld be a prognostication or signe of
some infortunate plage afterward to succ&eacute;ed. As he was not merie being absent from
his armie, so likewise his armie much maruelled, and no lesse mourned for his sudden
absence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Stanleie the earle of Richmond &amp; others m&eacute;et, embrace, and consult.</div>

<p>The next morning earlie in the dawning of the day he returned, and by the conduct
of good fortune, espied and came to his armie, excusing himselfe not to haue
gone out of the way by ignorance: but that for a policie (deuised for the nonce) he
went from his campe to receiue some glad message from certeine of his priuie fr&eacute;ends
and secret alies. This excuse made, he priuilie departed againe from his host to the
towne of Aderston, where the lord Stanleie and sir William his brother with their bands
were abiding. There the earle came first to his father in law, in a litle close, where
he saluted him, and sir William his brother: and after diuerse and fr&eacute;endlie imbracings,
each reioised of the state of other, and suddenlie were surprised with great ioy, comfort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
and hope of fortunate successe in all their affaires and dooings. Afterward they consulted
togither how to giue battell to king Richard if he would abide, whome they
knew not to be farre off with an huge host.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The principals of K. Richards power fall from him.</div>

<p>In the euening of the same day, sir Iohn Sauage, sir Brian Sanford, sir Simon
Digbie, and manie other, leauing king Richard, turned and came to the part of the
earle of Richmond, with an elect companie of men. Which refusall of king Richards
part, by men of such experience, did augment and increase both the good hope, and
the puissance of the earle of Richmond. In the meane season, king Richard which
was appointed now to finish his last labor by the very diuine iustice &amp; prouidence of
God (which called him to condigne punishment for his mischiefous deserts) marched
to a place m&eacute;et for two battels to incounter, by a village called Bosworth, not farre
from Leicester: and there he pitched his field on a hill called Anne Beame, refreshed
his souldiers, and tooke his rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dreame of king Richard the third foretelling him of his end.</div>

<p>The fame went, that he had the same night a dreadfull and terrible dreame: for it
s&eacute;emed to him being asl&eacute;epe, that he did s&eacute;e diuerse images like terrible diuels, which
pulled and haled him, not suffering him to take anie quiet or rest. The which strange
vision not so suddenlie strake his heart with a sudden feare, but it stuffed his head
and troubled his mind with manie busie and dreadfull imaginations. For incontinent
after, his heart being almost damped, he prognosticated before the doubtfull chance
of the battell to come; not vsing the alacritie and mirth of mind and countenance as
he was accustomed to doo before he came toward the battell. And least that it might
be suspected that he was abashed for feare of his enimies, and for that cause looked so
pitiouslie; he recited and declared to his familiar fr&eacute;ends in the morning his wonderfull
vision and fearefull dreame.</p>

<p>But I thinke this was no dreame, but a punction and pricke of his sinfull conscience:
for the conscience is so much more charged and aggr&eacute;eued, as the offense is
greater &amp; more heinous in degr&eacute;e. [So that king Richard, by this reckoning, must
n&eacute;eds haue a woonderfull troubled mind, because the d&eacute;eds that he had doone, as they
were heinous and vnnaturall, so did they excite and stirre vp extraordinarie motions
of trouble and vexations in his conscience.] Which sting of conscience, although it
strike not alwaie; yet at the last daie of extreame life, it is woont to shew and represent
to vs our faults and offenses, and the paines and punishments which hang ouer
our heads for the committing of the same, to the intent that at that instant, we for
our deserts being penitent and repentant, maie be compelled (lamenting and bewailing
our sinnes like forsakers of this world) iocund to depart out of this misch&eacute;efe
life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King Richard bringeth all his men into the plaine.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Norfolke and the earle of Surrie on K. Richards side.</div>

<p>Now to returne againe to our purpose. The next daie after, king Richard being
furnished with men &amp; all ablements of warre, bringing all his men out of their campe
into the plaine, ordered his fore-ward in a maruellous length, in which he appointed
both horsmen and footmen, to the intent to imprint in the hearts of them that looked
a farre off, a sudden terror and deadlie feare, for the great multitude of the armed
souldiers: and in the fore-front he placed the archers like a strong fortified trench or
bulworke. Ouer this battell was capteine, Iohn duke of Norffolke, with whome was
Thomas earle of Surrie his sonne. After this long vant-gard, followed king Richard
himselfe with a strong companie of chosen and approoued men of warre, hauing
horssemen for wings on both sides of his battell.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">The lord Stanleie refuseth to set the earles men in battell araie.</div>

<p>After that the earle of Richmond was departed from the communication of his
fr&eacute;ends (as you haue heard before) he began to be of a better stomach, and of a more
valiant courage, and with all diligence pitched his field iust by the campe of his enimies,
and there he lodged that night. In the morning betimes, he caused his men to put
on their armour, and apparell themselues readie to fight and giue battell; and sent
vnto the lord Stanleie (which was now come with his band into a place indifferent
betw&eacute;ene both the armies) requiring him with his men to approch n&eacute;ere to his armie,
and to helpe to set the souldiers in arraie. But he answered that the earle should set
his owne men in good order of battell, while he would arraie his companie, and come
to him in time conuenient. Which answer made otherwise than the earle thought or
would haue iudged, considering the oportunitie of the time &amp; the weight of the
businesse. And although he was ther withall a little vexed, &amp; began some what to
hang the head; yet he without anie time delaieng, compelled of necessitie, after this
maner instructed and ordered his men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle setteth his men in order and appointeth ch&eacute;efteins.</div>

<p>He made his fore-ward somewhat single and slender, according to the small number
of his people. In the front he placed the archers, of whome he made capteine Iohn
earle of Oxenford. To the right wing of the battell he appointed sir Gilbert Talbot
to be the leader. To the left wing, he assigned sir Iohn Sauage who had brought
thither with him a crue of right able personages, clad in white coats and hoods, which
mustered in the eies of their aduersaries right brimlie. The earle of Richmond himselfe,
with aid of the lord Stanleie, gouerned the battell, accompanied with the earle
of Penbroke, hauing a good companie of horssemen, and a small number of footmen.
For all his whole number exc&eacute;eded not fiue thousand men, beside the power of the
Stanleies, wherof thr&eacute;e thousand were in the field, vnder the standard of sir William
Stanleie. The kings number was double so much and more. When both these armies
were thus ordered, and all men readie to set forward, king Richard called his chiefteins
togither, and to them said as followeth.</p>


<h2>The oration of king Richard the third to the chiefteins of his armie.</h2>

<div class="sidenote">King Richard iustifieth himselfe and his gouernement.</div>

<p>My most faithfull and assured fellowes, most trustie &amp; welbeloued fr&eacute;ends, &amp; elected
capteins, by whose wisedome and policie I haue obteined the crowne, and type of this
famous realme, and noble region: by whose puissance &amp; valiantnesse I haue inioid and
possessed the state roiall &amp; dignitie of the same, maugre the ill will and seditious
attempts of all my cankered enimies, and insidious aduersaries: by whose prudent &amp;
politike counsell I haue so gouerned my realme, people, subiects, that I haue omitted
nothing apperteining to the office of a iust prince: nor you haue pretermitted nothing
belonging to the dutie of wise and sage councellors. So that I maie saie, and trulie
affirme, that your approoued fidelitie &amp; tried constancie, maketh me to bel&eacute;eue firmelie,
and thinke that I am an vndoubted king, and an indubitate prince.</p>

<p>And although in the adeption and obteining of the garland, I being seduced, and
prouoked by sinister councell, and diabolicall temptation, did commit a wicked and
detestable act: yet I haue with streict penance and salt tears (as I trust) expiated &amp;
cl&eacute;erelie purged the same offense: which abhominable crime I require you of frendship
as cl&eacute;erelie to forget, as I dailie remember to deplore and lament the same. If ye will
euen now diligentlie call to remembrance in what case and perplexitie we doo stand;
and in what doubtfull perill we be all intrapped; I doubt not but you in heart will
thinke, and with mouth confesse, that if euer amitie and faith preuailed betw&eacute;ene
prince and subiects, or betw&eacute;ene subiect and subiect; or if euer bond of alegiance
obliged the vassall to loue and serue his naturall souereigne lord; or if anie obligation
of dutie bound anie prince to aid &amp; defend his subiects; all these loues, bonds, and
duties of necessitie are now this day to be tried, shewed, and put in experience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He speaketh opprobriouslie of the earle of Richmond.</div>

<p>For if wise men saie true (as they doo not lie) there is some policie in getting, but
much more in k&eacute;eping; the one being but fortunes chance, &amp; the other high wit and
policie. For which cause, I with you, and you with me, must n&eacute;eds this day take
labour and paine, to k&eacute;epe and defend with force, that preheminence and possession,
which by your prudent deuises I haue gotten &amp; obteined. I doubt not but you know
how the diuell (continuall enimie to humane nature, disturber of concord, &amp; sower of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
sedition) hath entered into the heart of an vnknowne Welshman (whose father I neuer
knew, nor him personallie saw) exciting him to aspire and couet our realme, crowne,
and dignitie, and thereof cl&eacute;erelie to depriue and spoile vs and our posteritie. Ye s&eacute;e
further, how a companie of traitors, th&eacute;eues, outlawes, and runnagates of our owne
nation, be aiders and partakers of his feat and enterprise, readie at hand to ouercome
and oppresse vs.</p>

<p>You s&eacute;e also, what a number of beggerlie Britans and faint-hearted Frenchmen be
with him arriued to destroie vs, our wiues and children. Which imminent misch&eacute;efs
and apparant inconueniences, if we will withstand &amp; repell, we must liue togither as
brethren, fight togither like lions, &amp; feare not to die togither like men. And obseruing
and k&eacute;eping this rule and precept, bel&eacute;eue me, the fearefull hare neuer fled faster
before the gr&eacute;edie greihound, nor the sillie larke before the sparrowhawke, nor yet the
simple sh&eacute;epe before the rauenous woolfe; than your proud bragging aduersaries, astonied
and amazed with the onelie sight of your manlie visages, will fl&eacute;e, run, and skir out of
the field. For if you consider and wiselie ponder all things in your mind, you shall
perceiue, that we haue manifest causes, and apparant tokens of triumph and victorie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The K. would persuade his capteins that the earle of Richmond is not warrior.</div>

<p>And to begin with the erle of Richmond capteine of this rebellion, he is a Welsh
milkesop, a man of small courage, and of lesse experience in martiall acts and feats
of warre, brought vp by my moothers meanes: and mine, like a captiue in a close cage
in the court of Francis duke of Britaine; and neuer saw armie, nor was exercised in
martiall affaires: by reason wherof he neither can, nor is able by his owne will or
experience to guide or rule an hoast. For in the wit and policie of the capteine consisteth
the ch&eacute;efe adeption of the victorie, and ouerthrow of the enimies. Secondarilie
feare not, but put awaie all doubts; for when the traitors and runnagates of
our realme, shall s&eacute;e vs with banner displaied come against them, remembring their
oth, promise, and fidelitie made vnto vs, as to their souereigne lord and annointed king;
they shall be so pricked and stoong in the bottome of their scrupulous consciences,
that they for verie remorse and dread of the diuine plague, will either shamefullie fl&eacute;e,
or humblie submit themselues to our grace and mercie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frenchmen &amp; Britans great bosters small rosters.</div>

<p>And as for the Frenchmen and Britans, their valiantnesse is such, that our noble
progenitors, and your valiant parts haue them oftener vanquished and ouercome in one
moneth, than they in the beginning imagined possiblie to compasse and finish in a
whole yeare. What will you make of them? braggers without audacitie, drunckards
without discretion, ribalds without reason, cowards without resisting, and in conclusion,
the most effeminate and lasciuious people that euer shewed themselues in front of
battell; ten times more couragious to fl&eacute;e &amp; escape, than once to assault the breast of
our strong &amp; populous armie. Wherefore considering all these aduantages, expell
out of your thoughts all douts, auoid out of your minds all feare; and like valiant
champions aduance foorth your standards, &amp; assaie whether your enimies can decide
and trie the title of battell by dint of sword. Aduance (I say againe) forward my
capteines, in whome lacketh neither policie, wisedome, nor yet puissance. Euerie
one giue but one sure stripe, &amp; suerlie the iournie is ours. What preuaileth a handfull
to a whole realme?</p>

<div class="sidenote">K. Richards vaine confidence and bootlesse courage.</div>

<p>Desiring you (for the loue that you beare to me) and the affection that you haue to
your natiue and naturall countrie, and to the safegard of your prince &amp; your selues,
that you will this daie take to you your accustomed courage and couragious spirits, for the
defense and safegard of vs all. And as for me, I assure you, this daie I will triumph
by glorious victorie, or suffer death for immortall fame. For they be maimed and out
of the palace of fame disgraded, dieng without renowme, which doo not as much
prefer and exalt the perpetuall honour of their natiue countrie, as their owne mortall
and transitorie life. Now saint George to borow, let vs set forward, and remember
well, that I am he which shall with high aduancements reward and preferre the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>

dreadfull dastards.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This exhortation incouraged all such as fauoured him; but such as were present
(more for dread than loue) kissed them openlie, whome they inwardlie hated. Other
sware outwardlie to take part with such, whose death they secretlie compassed, and
inwardlie imagined. Other promised to inuade the kings enimies, which fled and
fought with fierce courage against the king. Other stood still and looked on, intending
to take part with the victors and ouercommers. So was his people to him
vnsure and vnfaithfull at his end, as he was to his nephues vntrue and vnnaturall in
his beginning. [How then was it possible that this princes regiment could long stand,
s&eacute;eing the preseruation and prorogation of his reigne consisted not in the loue of his
subiects? In place wherof bicause feare (yea seruile and forced feare succ&eacute;eded) he
was the sooner forsaken of his people, whose harts fell from him as isicles from a
penthouse in a sunnie daie; and in this case the poet saith truelie, and was well
worthie of credit when he craued it, saieng:</p>

<div class="sidenote">The person of the earle of Richmond described.</div>

<p>When the earle of Richmond knew by his foreriders that the king was so n&eacute;ere
imbatelled, he rode about his armie from ranke to ranke, &amp; from wing to wing,
giuing comfortable words to all men, and that finished (being armed at all p&eacute;eces,
sauing his helmet) mounted on a little hill, so that all his people might s&eacute;e and behold
him perfectlie, to their great reioising. For he was a man of no great stature,
but so formed and decorated with all gifts and lineaments of nature, that he s&eacute;emed
more an angelicall creature, than a terrestriall personage. His countenance and aspect
was ch&eacute;erefull and couragious, his haire yellow like the burnished gold, his eies graie
shining and quicke; prompt and readie in answering, but of such sobrietie, that it
could neuer be iudged whether he were more dull than quicke in speaking (such was
his temperance.) Now when he had ouerlooked his armie ouer euerie side, he paused
awhile, and after with a lowd voice and bold spirit spake to his companions these, or
the like words following.</p>


<h2>The oration of King Henrie the seauenth to his armie.</h2>

<p>If euer God gaue victorie to men fighting in a iust quarrell, or if he euer aided
such as made warre for the wealth &amp; tuition of their owne naturall and nutritiue
countrie, or if he euer succoured them which aduentured their liues for the rel&eacute;efe of
innocents, suppressing of malefactors and apparant offenders; no doubt my fellowes
&amp; fr&eacute;ends, but he of his bountifull goodnesse will this daie send vs triumphant victorie,
and a luckie iournie ouer our proud enimies, and arrogant aduersaries: for if
you remember and consider the verie cause of our iust quarell, you shall apparantlie
perceiue the same to be true, godlie, and vertuous. In the which I doubt not, but
God will rather aid vs (yea and fight for vs) than s&eacute;e vs vanquished and ouerthrowne
by such as neither feare him nor his laws, nor yet regard iustice or honestie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earles cause iust and right, &amp; therefore likelie of good successe.</div>

<p>Our cause is so iust, that no enterprise can be of more vertue, both by the lawes
diuine &amp; ciuill. For what can be a more honest, goodlie, or godlie quarrell, than to
fight against a capteine, being an homicide and murtherer of his owne bloud or progenie,
an extreame destroier of his nobilitie, and to his and our countrie and the
poore subiects of the same a deadlie mallet, a firie brand, and a burthen intollerable?
Beside him, consider who be of his band and companie: such as by murther and vntrueth
committed against their owne kin and linage, yea against their prince and souereigne
lord, haue disherited me and you, and wrongfullie deteine and vsurpe our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
lawfull patrimonie &amp; lineall inheritance. For he that calleth himselfe king, k&eacute;epeth
from me the crowne and regiment of this noble realme and countrie, contrarie to all
iustice and equitie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A great motiue to the nobles &amp; gentles assisting the earle.</div>

<p>Likewise, his mates and friends occupie your lands, cut downe your woods, and
destroie your manors, letting your wiues and children range abroade for their liuing:
which persons for their penance and punishment I doubt not, but God of his goodnes
will either deliuer into our hands, as a great gaine and bootie; or cause them (being
gr&eacute;eued and compuncted with the pricke of their corrupt consciences) cowardlie
to flie, and not abide the battell. Beside this I assure you, that there be yonder in
the great battell, men brought thither for feare, and not for loue; souldiers by force
compelled, and not with good will assembled; persons which desire rather the destruction
than saluation of their maister and capteine: and finallie, a multitude,
whereof the most part will be our friends, and the least part our enimies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">K. Richards offenses and ill qualities summarilie touched by the earle.</div>

<p>For truelie I doubt which is greater, the malice of the soldiors toward their capteine;
or the feare of him conceiued of his people. For suerlie this rule is infallible,
that as ill men dailie couet to destroie the good; so God appointeth the good men to
confound the ill. And of all worldlie goods the greatest is to suppresse tyrants, and
rel&eacute;eue innocents; whereof the one is as much hated, as the other is beloued. If this
be true (as clearkes preach) who will spare yonder tyrant Richard duke of Glocester,
vntruelie calling himselfe king, considering that he hath violated and broken both
the lawes of God and man? What vertue is in him which was the confusion of his
brother, and murtherer of his nephues? What mercie is in him that sleieth his trustie
fr&eacute;ends as well as his extreame enimies? Who can haue confidence in him which
putteth diffidence in all men?</p>

<div class="sidenote">K. Richard a notorious tyrant.</div>

<p>If you haue not read, I haue heard good clearkes saie, that Tarquine the proud for
the vice of the bodie lost the kingdome of Rome; and the name of Tarquine banished
the citie for euer: yet was not his fault so detestable as the fact of cruell Nero, which
slue his own mother, and opened hir entrailes, to behold the place of his conception.
Behold yonder Richard, which is both Tarquine and Nero: yea a tyrant more
than Nero, for he hath not onlie murthered his nephue being his king and souereigne
lord, bastarded his noble brethren, and defamed the wombe of his vertuous and womanlie
mother; but also compassed all the meanes and waies that he could inuent,
how to defile and carnallie know his owne n&eacute;ece, under the pretense of a cloked matrimonie,
which ladie I haue sworne and promised to take to my mate and wife, as
you all know and bel&eacute;eue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In encouragements to his armie to plaie the men in a iust cause.</div>

<p>If this cause be not iust, and this quarell godlie; let God (the giuer of victorie)
iudge and determine. We haue (thanks be giuen to Christ) escaped the secret treasons
in Britaine, and auoided the subtill snares of our fraudulent enimies there,
passed the troublous seas in good and quiet safegard, and without resistance haue
ouergone the ample region &amp; large countrie of Wales, and are now come to the place
which we so much desired: for long we haue sought the furious bore, and now we
haue found him. Wherefore let vs not feare to enter into the toile, where we may
suerlie sleie him; for God knoweth that we haue liued in the vales of miserie, tossing
our ships in dangerous stormes: let vs not now dread to set vp our full sailes in faire
weather, hauing with vs both God and good fortune.</p>

<p>If we had come to conquer Wales and had atchiued it, our praise had b&eacute;ene great,
and our gaine more: but if we win this battell, the whole rich realme of England,
with the lords and rulers of the same, shall be ours; the profit shall be ours, and the
honour shall be ours. Therefore labour for your game, &amp; sweat for your right.
While we were in Britaine, we had small liuings and little plentie of wealth or welfare,
now is the time come to get aboundance of riches, and copie of profit; which is the
reward of your seruice, and merit of your paines. And this remember with your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
selues, that before vs be our enimies; and on either side of vs be such, as I neither
suerlie trust, nor greatlie bel&eacute;eue; backeward we cannot fl&eacute;e; so that h&eacute;ere we stand
like sh&eacute;epe in a fold, circumuented and compassed betw&eacute;ene our enimies and our doutfull
friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Victorie consisteth not in multitude but in manlinesse.</div>

<p>Wherefore let all feare be set aside, and like sworne brethren let vs ioine in one; for
this daie shall be the end of our trauell, and the gaine of our labour, either by honorable
death or famous victorie: and as I trust, the battell shall not be so sowre, as the
profit shall be sw&eacute;et. Remember that victorie is not gotten with the multitudes of
men, but with the courages of hearts, and valiantnesse of minds. The smaller that
our number is, the more glorie is to vs if we vanquish: if we be ouercome, yet no
laud is to be attributed to the victors, considering that ten men fought against one.
And if we die so glorious a death in so good a quarell, neither fretting time, nor cancarding
obliuion, shall be able to darken or rase out of the booke of fame either our

good a cause, and so notable a quarrell, you shall find me this daie rather a dead carrion
vpon the cold ground, than a fr&eacute;e prisoner on a carpet in a ladies chamber.</p>

<p>Let vs therefore fight like inuincible giants, and set on our enimies like vntimorous
tigers, &amp; banish all feare like ramping lions. And now aduance forward true men
against traitors, pitifull persons against murtherers, true inheritors against vsurpers, the
scourges of God against tyrants. Displaie my banner with a good courage, march
foorth like strong and robustious champions, and begin the battell like hardie conquerors.
The battell is at hand, and the victorie approcheth; and if we shamefullie
recule, or cowardlie fl&eacute;e; we and all our sequele be destroied, and dishonored for euer.
This is the daie of gaine, and this is the time of losse; get this daie victorie, and be
conquerors: and l&eacute;ese this daies battell, and be villaines. And therefore in the name
of God and S. George, let euerie man couragiouslie aduance foorth his standard.</p>

<p>These ch&eacute;erefull words he set foorth with such gesture of his bodie, &amp; smilling countenance,
as though alreadie he had vanquished his enimies, and gotten the spoile. He
had scantlie finished his saieng, but the one armie spied the other. Lord how hastilie
the soldiers buckled their healmes, how quicklie the archers bent their bowes and
frushed their feathers, how readilie the bilmen shooke their billes, and prooued their
staues, readie to approach and ioine, when the terrible trumpet should sound the
bloudie blast to victorie or death! Betw&eacute;ene both armies there was a great marish then
(but at this present, by reason of diches cast, it is growne to be firme ground) which
the earle of Richmond left on his right hand; for this intent, that it shouid be on
that side a defense for his part, and in so dooing he had the sunne at his backe, and in
the faces of his enimies. When king Richard saw the earles companie was passed the
marish; he did command with all hast to set vpon them. Then the trumpets sounded,
and the souldiers shouted, and the kings archers couragiouslie let flie their arrowes.
The earles bowmen stood not still, but paied them home againe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Oxfords charge to his band of men.</div>

<p>The terrible shot once passed, the armies ioined and came to hand-strokes, where
neither sword nor bill was spared. At which incounter, the lord Stanleie ioined with
the earle. The earle of Oxford in the meane season, fearing least while his companie
was fighting, they should be compassed and circumuented with the multitude of the
enimies, gaue commandement in euerie ranke, that no man should be so hardie, as to
go aboue ten foot from the standard. Which commandment once knowne, they knit
themselues togither, and ceassed a little from fighting. The aduersaries suddenlie
abashed at the matter, and mistrusting some fraud and deceit, began also to pause
and left striking; and not against the wils of manie, which had rather had the
king destroied, than saued, and therefore they fought verie faintlie, or stood
still.</p>

<p>The earle of Oxford, bringing all his band togither on the one part, set on his enimies;
freshlie againe. The adversaries perceiuing that, placed their men slender and
thin before, but thicke and broad behind, beginning againe hardilie the battell.
While the two fore-wards thus mortallie fought, ech intending to vanquish and conuince
the other; king Richard was admonished by his explorators and espials, that
the earle of Richmond (accompanied with a small number of men of armes) was not
far off. And as he approched and marched toward him, he perfectlie knew his personage;
by certeine demonstrations and tokens, which he had learned and knowen of
others that were able to giue him full information. Now being inflamed with ire, and
vexed with outragious malice, he put his spurres to his horsse, and rode out of the
side of the range of his battell, leauing the vant-gard fighting; and like a hungrie
lion ran with speare in rest toward him. The earle of Richmond perceiued well the
king furiouslie comming toward him, and bicause the whole hope of his wealth and
purpose was to be determined by battell, he gladlie preferred to incounter with him
bodie to bodie, and man to man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The kings armie

<p>King Richard set on so sharplie at the first brunt, that he ouerthrew the earles
standard, and slue sir William Brandon his standard-bearer (which was father to sir
Charles Brandon by king Henrie the eight created duke of Suffolke) and matched
hand to hand with sir Iohn Cheinie, a man of great force and strength, which would
haue resisted him: but the said Iohn was by him manfullie ouerthrowen. And so he
making open passage by dint of sword as he went forward, the earle of Richmond
withstood his violence, and kept him at the swords point without aduantage, longer
than his companions either thought or iudged: which being almost in despaire of victorie,
were suddenlie recomforted by sir William Stanleie, which came to his succors
with thr&eacute;e thousand tall men. At which verie instant, king Richards men were driuen
backe and fled, &amp; he himselfe manfullie fighting in the middle of his enimies, was

<p>In the meane season, the earle of Oxford with the aid of the lord Stanleie, after no
long fight, discomfited the fore-ward of king Richard, whereof a great number were
slaine in the chase and fight: but the greatest number which (compelled by feare of
the king, and not of their m&eacute;ere voluntarie motion) came to the field, gaue neuer a
stroke, and hauing no harme nor damage, safelie departed, which came not thither
in hope to s&eacute;e the king prosper and preuaile, but to heare that he should be shamefullie
confounded and brought to ruine. In this battell died few aboue the number of
a thousand persons: and of the nobilitie were slaine Iohn duke of Norffolke, which
was warned by diuerse to refraine from the field, in so much that the night
before he should set forward toward the king, one wrote this rime vpon his

<p>Yet all this notwithstanding, he regarded more his oth, his honor, and promise
made to king Richard, like a gentleman; and as a faithfull subiect to his prince, absented
not himselfe from his maister; but as he faithfullie liued vnder him, so he manfullie
died with him, to his great fame and laud. And therfore, though his seruice was
ill imploied in aid of a tyrant (whome it had b&eacute;ene more honorable to haue suppressed
than supported) yet bicause he had vpon his fealtie vndertaken to fight in his quarell,
he thought it lesse losse of life and liuing than of glorie &amp; honour: so that he

<div class="sidenote">What persons of name were slaine on king Richards side.</div>

<p>There were slaine beside him, Walter lord Ferrers of Chartleie, sir Richard Radcliffe,
and Robert Brakenberie lieutenant of the Tower, and not manie gentlemen
more. Sir William Catesbie learned in the lawes of the realme, and one of the ch&eacute;efe
councellors to the late king, with diuerse other, were two daies after beheaded at
Leicester. Amongst them that ran awaie, were sir Francis vicount Louell, and Humfreie
Stafford, and Thomas Stafford his brother, which tooke sanctuarie in saint Iohns
at Glocester. Of captiues and prisoners there were a great number. For after the
death of king Richard was knowne and published, euerie man in manner vnarming
himselfe, &amp; casting awaie his abiliments of warre, m&eacute;ekelie submitted themselues to
the obeisance and rule of the earle of Richmond: of the which the more part had
gladlie so doone in the beginning, if they might haue conuenientlie escaped from king
Richards espials, which hauing as cl&eacute;ere eies as Lynx, and open eares as Midas,
ranged &amp; searched in euerie quarter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Earl of Surreie co&#772;mitted to the Tower notwithstanding his submission.</div>

<p>Amongst these was Henrie the fourth earle of Northumberland, which (whether it
was by the commandement of King Richard, putting diffidence in him; or he did it
for the loue and fauour that he bare vnto the earle) stood still with a great companie,
and intermitted not in the battell, which was incontinentlie receiued into fauour and
made of the councell. But Thomas Howard earle of Surreie, which submitted himselfe
there, was not taken to grace; bicause his father was chiefe councellor, and he
greatlie familiar with king Richard, but committed to the Tower of London, where he
long remained; and in conclusion deliuered, was for his truth and fidelitie after promoted
to high honors, offices and dignities. On the earle of Richmonds part were
slaine scarse one hundred persons, among whome the principall was sir Willam Brandon
his standard-bearer. This battell was fought at Bosworth in Leicestershire, the
two and twentith daie of August, in the yeare of our redemption 1485. The whole
conflict indured litle aboue two houres.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How king Richard might haue escaped.</div>

<p>King Richard (as the fame went) might haue escaped and gotten safegard by
fl&eacute;eing. For when they, which were next about his person, saw and perceiued at the
first ioining of the battell the souldiers faintlie and nothing couragiouslie to set on their
enimies; and not onlie that, but also that some withdrew themselues priuilie out of
the prease and departed; they began to suspect fraud and to smell treason; and not
onelie exhorted, but determinatlie aduised him to saue himselfe by flight. And when
the losse of the battell was imminent and apparant, they brought to him a swift and
a light horsse, to conueie him awaie. He which was not ignorant of the grudge and
ill will that the common people bare toward him, casting awaie all hope of fortunate
successe and happie chance to come, answered (as men saie) that on that daie he
would make an end of all battels, or else there finish his life. Such a great audacitie
and such a stomach reigned in his bodie.</p>

<p>For suerlie he knew that to be the daie, in the which it should be decided and determined
whether he should peaceablie obteine and inioy his kingdome during his
life, or else vtterlie forgo and be depriued of the same. With which too much hardines
he being ouercome, hastilie closed his helmet, and entered fiercelie into the hard
battell, to the intent to obteine that daie a quiet reigne and regiment; or else to finish
there his vnquiet life, and vnfortunat gouernance. And so this miser at the same verie
point had like chance and fortune, as happeneth to such which in place of right
iustice and honestie, following their sensuall appetite, loue, and vse to imbrace mischiefe,
tyrannie, and vnthriftinesse. Suerlie these be examples of more vehemencie,
than mans toong can expresse, to feare and astonish such euill persons, as will not liue
one houre vacant from dooing and exercising crueltie, mischiefe, or outragious liuing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The deuout behauior of the earle of Richmond after the victorie.</div>

<p>When the earle had thus obtained victorie, and slaine his mortall enimie, he kn&eacute;eled
downe and rendred to almightie God his hartie thanks, with deuout and godlie orisons;
bes&eacute;eching his goodnesse to send him grace to aduance and defend the catholike faith;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
and to mainteine iustice and concord amongst his subiects and people, by God now to
his gouernance committed &amp; assigned. Which praier finished, he replenished with incomparable
gladnesse ascended vp to the top of a little mounteine, where he not onelie
praised and lauded his valiant souldiers; but also gaue vnto them his hartie thanks, with
promise of condigne recompense for their fidelitie and valiant facts, willing and commanding
all the hurt and wounded persons to be cured, and the dead carcasses to be
deliuered to the sepulture. Then the people reioised, and clapped their hands, crieng
vp to heauen; King Henrie, king Henrie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Stanleie setteth the crowne on king Henries head.</div>

<p>When the lord Stanleie saw the good will and gladnesse of the people, he tooke
the crowne of king Richard which was found amongst the spoile in the field, and set
it on the earles head; as though he had b&eacute;ene elected king by the voice of the people,
as in ancient times past in diuerse realmes it hath b&eacute;ene accustomed: and this was the
first signe and token of his good lucke and felicitie, &para;I must put you here in
remembrance, how that king Richard (putting some diffidence in the lord Stanleie)
had with him as an hostage the lord Strange, his eldest sonne, which lord Stanleie
(as ye haue heard before) ioined not at the first with his sonne in lawes armie, for
feare the king would haue slaine the lord Strange his heire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Stanlies bold answer to K. Richards purseuant.</div>

<p>When king Richard was come to Bosworth, he sent a purseuant to the lord Stanleie,
commanding him to aduance forward with his companie, and to come to his presence;
which thing if he refused to doo, he sware by Christes passion, that he would strike
off his sonnes head before he dined. The lord Stanleie answered the purseuant that
if the king did so, he had more sonnes aliue; and as to come to him, he was not then
so determined. When king Richard heard this answer, he commanded the lord
Strange incontinent to be beheaded; which was at that verie same season, when both
the armies had sight ech of other. But the councellors of king Richard pondered the
time and cause, knowing also the lord Strange to be innocent of his fathers offense, &amp;
persuaded the king that it was now time to fight, &amp; no time to execute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proclamation made to bring in the lord Strange.</div>

<p>Besides that, they aduised him to k&eacute;epe the lord Strange as prisoner till the battell
were ended, and then at leisure his pleasure might be accomplished. So (as God
would) king Richard brake his holie oth, and the lord was deliuered to the k&eacute;epers of
the kings tents, to be kept as prisoner. Which, when the field was doone, and their
maister slaine, and proclamation made to know where the child was, they submitted
themselues as prisoners to the lord Strange, and he gentlie receiued them, and brought
them to the new proclamed king; where, of him and of his father he was receiued
with great ioy. After this the whole campe remooued with bag and baggage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The shamefull cariage of K. Richards bodie to Leicester.</div>

<p>The same night in the euening, king Henrie with great pompe came to the towne of
Leicester; where as well for the refreshing of his people &amp; souldiers, as for preparing
all things necessarie for his iournie toward London, he rested and reposed himselfe
two daies. In the meane season the dead corps of king Richard was as shamefullie
caried to the towne of Leicester, as he gorgeouslie (the day before) with pompe and
pride departed out of the same towne. For his bodie was naked and despoiled to the
skin, and nothing left about him, not so much as a clout to couer his priuie members,
and was trussed behind a purseuant of arms, one Blanch Senglier, or White bore, like
a hog or calfe, his head and armes hanging on the one side of the horsse, and his legs
on the other side, and all besprinkled with mire and bloud he was brought to the graie
friers church within the towne, and there laie like a miserable spectacle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">K. Richards badge and cognisance euerie where defaced.</div>

<p>But suerlie considering his mischiefous acts and vngratious dooings, men maie
woonder at such a caitife, who although he deserued no buriall place either in church
or churchyard, chappell or chancell, but otherwise to haue bin bestowed: yet in the
said church he was with no lesse funerall pompe &amp; solemnitie interred, than he would
to be doone at the buriall of his innocent nephues, whome he caused cruellie to be
murthered, and vnnaturallie killed. Now when his death was knowne, few lamented
and manie reioiced. The proud bragging white bore (which was his badge) was
violentlie rased &amp; plucked downe from euerie signe and place where it might be espied:
so ill was his life, that men wished the memorie of him to be buried with his carren
corps. He reigned two y&eacute;ers, two moneths, and one daie [too long by six and twentie
moneths, and foure and twentie houres in most mens opinions, to whome his name
and presence was as sw&eacute;et and delectable, as his dooings princelie, and his person
amiable.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">The description of king Richard.</div>

<p>As he was small and little of stature, so was he of bodie greatlie deformed; the one
shoulder higher than the other; his face was small, but his countenance cruell, and
such, that at the first aspect a man would iudge it to sauour and smell of malice, fraud,
and deceit. When he stood musing, he would bite and chaw busilie his nether lip;
as who said, that his fierce nature in his cruell bodie alwaies chafed, stirred, and was
euer vnquiet: beside that, the dagger which he ware, he would (when he studied)
with his hand plucke vp &amp; downe in the sheath to the midst, neuer drawing it fullie
out: he was of a readie, pregnant, and quicke wit, wilie to feine, and apt to
dissemble: he had a proud mind, and an arrogant stomach, the which accompanied
him euen to his death, rather choosing to suffer the same by dint of sword, than
being forsaken and left helpelesse of his vnfaithfull companions, to preserue by cowardlie
flight such a fraile and vncerteine life, which by malice, sicknesse, or condigne
punishment was like shortlie to come to confusion.</p>

<p>Thus ended this prince his mortall life with infamie and dishonor, which neuer preferred
fame or honestie before ambition, tyrannie and mischiefe. And if he had continued
still protector, and suffered his nephues to haue liued and reigned, no doubt
but the realme had prospered, &amp; he as much praised &amp; loued as he is now had in hatred:
but to God, which knew his inward thoughts at the houre of his death, I remit the punishment
of his offenses commited in his life; which if the one be as manifold as the
other, Gods iustice were not to be charged with crueltie. For by nature he is mercifull,
slow to anger, and loth to smite: but yet euerie sinne (in respect of his righteousnesse)
being deadlie (much more heinous and horrible) how can he but by iustice
(which is an essentiall vertue in him) punish it seuerelie? And if he did it with ten
thousand torments, who shall be so hardie as to expostulate and reason why he so
dooth?</p>

<div class="sidenote">S&eacute;e pag. 324.</div>

<p>But to leaue the tyrant as he died, you shall vnderstand that K. Henrie the seuenth
caused a toome to be made and set vp ouer the place where he was buried, in the
church of the graie friers at Leicester, with a picture of alabaster representing his
person, dooing that honour to his enimie, vpon a princelie regard and pitifull zeale,
which king Richard (mooued of an hypocritical shew of counterfeit pitie) did to
Henrie the sixt, whom he had first cruellie murthered, and after in the second
yeare of his vsurped reigne, caused his corps to be remooued from Chertseie vnto
Windsore, and there solemnlie interred. And now to conclude with this cruell tyrant
king Richard, we may consider in what sort the ambitious desire to rule and gouerne
in the house of Yorke, was punished by Gods iust prouidence.</p>

to s&eacute;eke to preuent the time appointed him by authoritie of parlement to atteine to
the crowne intailed to him and his issue; in whome also, and not onelie in himselfe,
that offense (as maie b&eacute;e thought) was dulie punished. For although his eldest sonne
Edward the fourth, b&eacute;eing a prince right prouident and circumspect for the suertie of
his owne estate and his children, insomuch that not content to cut off all his armed
and apparant enimies, he also of a gealous feare, made awaie his brother the duke of

for (as ye haue partlie heard) he did but further thereby the destruction of his
issue, in taking awaie him that onlie might haue staied the crueltie of his brother of
Glocester, who inraged for desire of the kingdome, bereft his innocent nephues of
their liues &amp; estates.</p>

<p>And as it thus well appeared, that the house of Yorke shewed it selfe more bloudie
in s&eacute;eking to obteine the kingdome, than that of Lancaster in vsurping it: so it came
to passe, that the Lords vengeance appeared more heauie towards the same than toward
the other, not ceassing till the whole issue male of the said Richard duke of Yorke
was extinguished. For such is Gods iustice, to leaue no vnrepentant wickednesse
vnpunished, as especiallie in this caitife Richard the third, not deseruing so much as
the name of a man, much lesse of a king, most manifestlie appeareth. [At whom we

cohabitation, but the vniuersall iudgment of Italie was, that he died not of
infirmities naturall, nor by incontinencie, but by poison and violent compulsion.
Wherof Theodor de Pauia, one of the physicians, assisting when the king visited him,
assured the king to s&eacute;e most apparant and manifest signes: and if h&eacute;e were dispatched
by poison, there was none that doubted that his vncle was innocent, either directlie
or indirectlie; as he, who not content with an absolute power to be gouernor of the
state, but aspiring according to the common desires of great men, to make themselues
glorious with titles and honors; and speciallie he judged, that both for his proper
suertie and the succession of his children, the death of the lawfull prince was necessarie,
and therefore thought to establish in himselfe the power and name of duke.
Wherin ambition and couetousnesse preuailed aboue conscience and law of nature, and
the gealous desire of dominion inforced his disposition (otherwise abhorring bloud) to
that vile action.</p>

ioined with misfortune and vnluckinesse (as is noted[3] before.) So that for infelicitie
it might well be compared vnto the name of Ione, a name vnhappie and much accurssed
for the kingdome of Naples. As for king Richard, better had it b&eacute;ene for him to
haue contented his heart with the protectorship, than to haue cast vp his snout, or lifted
vp his hornes of ambition so high (and that with a setled intent) as to hacke and hew
downe by violent blowes all likelie impediments betwixt him and home. Better (I
